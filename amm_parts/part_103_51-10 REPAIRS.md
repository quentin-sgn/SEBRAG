The described procedures concern only to relatively minor damage. Large-scale
repairs may be performed only by the manufacturer or authorized repair station.
Sandwich shells, from which the aircraft comprises, are difficult to repair. The
disclosed methods are applicable only to minor repairs of coatings sandwich shells.
Every material used for repairs must be suitable for the appropriate repair.
Before repairs provide a needed fabrics reserve in sufficient quantity. Fabrics are
sensitive to moisture; therefore they need to be properly stored in a cool, dry, dark
place. For proper storage, resin and fabric is necessary to follow the manufacturer's
recommendations.
Abrupt changes in the thickness of the laminate should be avoided in order to
prevent stress concentration. If possible, cut pieces of fabric to be oval or circular
instead of rectangular shape. The transition between the repaired and undamaged
area should be gradual and as smooth as possible.
Chamfering of the coarse fabric has to be in the range 1:50 to 1:100, the fine fabric
has the no chamfering and must be folded.
Epoxy resins, hardeners and all kinds of fabrics are hygroscopic. In the event of
increase of water content in the resin or the hardener, the epoxy composition will be
cloudy and milky appearance. This composition is unusable.
A relative atmospheric humidity for lamination should be in the range of 20 to 50 %.
At the relative humidity is higher than 50 %, the time to start gelation of the mixture
reduces. Also increases the weight of the product due to moisture absorption of the
epoxy mixture. Increased moisture during production has no significant effect on the
mechanical properties of the cured product.

###### 2. REPAIR CLASSIFICATION
The repairs are divided according to the influence to the airworthiness of all aircraft
into following classes:

**A.** **Repair Class 1**
Large damages required a partial replacement of the airframe, large repairs or
repair of main structure can be carried out only by the aircraft manufacturer or a
repair workshop approved by local Civil Aviation Authority. The repair procedure
is not provided and must be prepared individually after damage examination.

**B.** **Repair Class 2**
Destruction of the whole shell (also the inner laminate is destroyed), however
small size only.

**C.** **Repair Class 3**
Simple surface damage (only the outer laminate is damaged) and small
damage of the foam filling.

**D.** **Repair Class 4**
The damages caused by the scores and the scrapes without the outer laminate
damage and without the breakage of the element.

###### 3. CONSTRUCTION
WT9 Dynamic LSA airframe consists of a sandwich shells from composite material.
The shell is of three-layer construction. The external and internal shell layers are
made of a glass and carbon fibre fabrics, which are saturated with a resin. Between
them there is a filling from a hard foam panels (polyurethane foam HEREX from 3 to
15 mm thick).

###### 5. REPAIR PREPARATION
For all repairs, it is important to know the number of layers of the laminate, density of
weave and directional fabrics fibers orientation relative to the main part dimensions.
The first step is removing all damage parts and all portion of the shell that has
become delaminated from a damage area. Repair area wash with soap and dry up.
Then degrease a repair area. Repaired surface roughen with the sandpaper No. 60
to 80. Areas that could be damaged and dirty during work protect with a foil. Fabrics
must not have high relative air humidity, as necessary they dry up, for example by a
hot air gun.
Prepare clean vessels for stirring the mixtures of a resin and a hardener.

**A.** **Repair Class 4**
The erosion damages caused by the rain, the scores, the scrapes without the
outer laminate damage require the lacquer works only.
See Chapter 51-20 Exterior finish repair.
In case of first cloth layer damage, then whole repair area cleans well and
sands smooth with a sand paper. Prepare cloth on the foil, saturate with resin
and lay on the repair area. If the resin is dry, the repair area can be puttied
and repainted with lacquer.

**B.** **Repair Class 3**
On the damaged area of the outer shell cut a circular or rounded hole with
sufficiently size. Make sure that all delaminated parts of the shell have been
removed. If the foam is also damaged, remove it too, eventually to the internal
shell layer. Tap the surroundings of the damage area to determine the extent of
delamination from the foam. Remove the lacquer from the edge of the cut hole
at least 4 cm by means sandpaper.
Around the edge of the damaged area where the shell is still firmly bonded,
chamfer the shell. For top thin cloth layer the chamfer about 15 mm is
necessary.
After chamfering the shell, blow out thoroughly the whole repair area including
the pores of the foam. Now fill the hole in the foam with microballoons and
simultaneously fill the pores of the exposed foam. Then lay necessary layer of
patches with diagonal weave direction (stepwise largest patch first) over the
damaged area. After hardening (app. 8 hours at 20°C) the damaged area
should be smoothed, filled and painted. In smoothing take care that only the
edges of the patches are sanded.

**GENERAL**

**C.** **Repair Class 2**
If there is a through hole in the sandwich shell, then remove all delaminated
parts and sand the edge of the hole. Enlarge the hole until good bonding to the
foam is evidenced. Then remove the foam next 20 mm around the hole while
the inner fabric remains undamaged. On thus exposed inner fabric make
chamfer around the circumference. Outer fabric layer chamfer about 20 mm.

_Fig. 51-2 Repair Class 3 – Step 1_

If the hole is not greater than 10 cm, then glue with Super Glue a thin laminate
plate from bottom of the hole. Glued laminate can be supported by means of the
nail or wire. Then lay inner layer of patches. Allow the inner layer harden before
doing further work. Trim the inserted foam according the hole. Glue the foam
plug in the hole with thickened resin (microballoons) (to close the pores).

_Fig. 51-3 Repair Class 3 – Step 2_

The foam with laminate on one side is flexible so that it can be fitted to the
repair place contour (if necessary warm the foam with hairdryer and bend).
Once the foam is glued it can be smoothed, puttied with microballoons and the
outer laminate layers applied.

Each fabric must be properly oriented with respect to the long side of the aircraft. The
patch must be composed of an equal number of layers as a repair area plus one
technology layer that prevents damage of the top layer due to finishing.
The table shows the layers necessary for repairs in order from the outer to the inner.
Repair the damage are allowed only 5 cm from the spar, rib or bulkhead. If there was
also damage the spar, bulkhead, contact the manufacturer.
If the collar on the leading edges of the wings and horizontal stabilizer is damaged, it
is necessary to laminate new ones.

###### 7. REPAIRS OF METAL PARTS
In case of a damage of any fittings, if a damage reason was not designate
immediately, contact the aircraft manufacturer. It is necessary take account to an
element function, a material composition, a processing technology and etc. The
aircraft manufacturer can evaluate all these factors only.
Welding should be carried out only by an approved aircraft welder. All welds made by
the aircraft manufacturer are by the Argon-arc welding method.

###### 8. REPAIRS OF PLEXIGLASS
Type of maintenance: Line

Personnel qualification: Independent certifying staff qualified in accordance

with Part-66 or higher.

Recommended tools, materials, persons and documentation:

ITEM QUANTITY

Driller Ø1.5 – 2.0 AR

_Tab. 51-4 Recommended tools, materials, persons and documentation_

Most common damage which occurs on plexiglass are cracks, which usually start
around vent windows rails as result of using of these windows to open or close the
canopy.
When the crack occurs, it is important to stop its propagation immediately after
discovering it. This can be done by drilling a hole in direction of crack trajectory.
The hole has to be drilled perpendicular to surface, on farthermost visible point
of the crack (crack tip). This has to be done for each crack tip, except the end is in
hole, or on edge. Diameter of the hole should not be less than 1 mm, and not greater
than 2 mm.

###### 9. TEST FLIGHT AFTER REPAIR

 WARNING

**ONLY QUALIFIED PILOT MAY PERFORM A TEST FLIGHT!**

The test flight should be performed above all in following cases:
After repair or replace of fixed surfaces – wing, fin, stabilizer, or control surfaces –
elevator, aileron and wing flap. Flight characteristics and aircraft stability can be
affected when above mentioned part is replaced or adjusted. Therefore a test flight
should be performed to check aircraft flight characteristics, control surfaces setting,
manoeuvrability, stability, and stall characteristics. The characteristics are check
during taxiing, take-off, climbing, cruise, descent, approach and landing. To record
the data collected during a flight test, use the Flight Test Record (see Chapter xx,
Supplements).

Test flight flying time takes about 40 minutes, if the test flight is performed
according to the Flight Test Record.

**B.** **Aircraft inspection before a Test flight:**
Prior to the test flight the aircraft shall be thoroughly inspected, weighed, found
faults debugged and the aircraft shall be prepared for the flight (replenishing
etc.).

**C.** **Test crew:**
Only qualified persons (test pilots) are permitted to perform a test flight. In-flight
found faults should be debugged forthwith the test flight
