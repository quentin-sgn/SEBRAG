###### 1. DESCRIPTION
EVRA PerformanceLine 175/xxx/805.5 is 3-blade, on ground adjustable propeller
with diameter 1.750 m (68.90 in). Its blades have wooden core covered with glass
fabric, stiffened with metal leading edges. Blades are fixed in aluminium hub.
Propeller's hub is through spinner flange and a flange connected to engine's

(1) Propeller removal:
(a) Make sure that the ignition switch is set to OFF.

(b) Remove the engine cowlings (Chapter 71-10).

(c) Disconnect negative terminal of battery (Chapter 24-30).

(d) Remove upper line of spark plugs from the engine.

(e) Unscrew bolts (7, Fig. 61-1) with washers (8) and remove the
propeller spinner (6).

(f) Unscrew and remove nuts (3) and washers (4); hold the propeller (1).

(g) Pull the propeller forward; remove the bolts (2) with washers (4),
balance weight (5), propeller (1) and flanges (9; 10) from the engine
flange.

(h) Put the protective covers on the propeller blades and store the
propeller on a safe place so that no damage can occur.

(i) As necessary, disassemble flanges (9; 10), by unscrewing the bolts
(11) and removing washers (12).

(2) Propeller installation:
(a) Make sure that the ignition switch is set to OFF.

(b) Make sure that the battery is disconnected and upper line of spark
plugs is removed from the engine.

(c) Check the contacting areas of the flange (13, Fig. 61-1), flanges
(9, 10) and the propeller (1). Clear of all impurities.

(d) Remove protective covers from the propeller blades and carry out
visual check of the propeller integrity and condition.

(e) If flanges (9, 10) are disassembled, use washers (12) and bolts (11)
secure using Loctite 243.

###### CAUTION

PAY ATTENTION TO ALIGNMENT MARKS (ARROWS).

(f) Attach the assemble flanges (9; 6), propeller (1), and balance weight (5)
on engine flange (13) by means of the bolts (2), washers (4) and nuts
(3).

(g) After the propeller is correctly positioned on the engine in accordance
with instructions of the engine manual, tighten bolts in order as
described on Fig. 61-2. Tighten bolts (2) to torque moment 22 Nm.
The rated torque of bolts should be applied gradually, in three
successive operations. The torque of each operation will be increased
starting from 1/3 of the nominal value.

(h) Measure the difference in distance of individual blade tips from
marking (see Fig. 61-3). The end of the other blade has to be within
range ±3 mm. If tolerance is exceeded, do not start the engine
operation and investigate the cause.

(a) Put the propeller on a spindle.

(b) Release bolts (2, Fig. 61-1; 3, Fig. 61-4) so that it is possible to
adjust angle of attack of blades.

(c) Put the propeller blade horizontal (Fig. 61-5). Put protractor on
reference point 200 mm from tip of the blade.

(d) Set blade to vertical position. Set reference angle on protractor to 23°
and turn the blade around its axis to 23°. Tighten bolts (3, Fig. 61-4)
around currently adjusted blade.

(e) Repeat the same procedure (d) for other blades.

(6) Propeller balancing:
(a) Put complete propeller (flanges, propeller, weight and spinner) on a
balancer.

(b) If the propeller is out of balance, the heaviest blade will turn
downward.

(c) To balance the propeller use balancing weights and stick to inside of
rear flange (9, Fig. 61-1) on the opposite side of the heavy blade.

(d) Repeat this procedure (steps “b” and “c”) until all blades remain stillregardless of propeller position.

(7) Propeller inspection:
(a) If dirty, clean blades with soapy water (Chapter 12-20)

(b) Check for cracks.

(c) Check metal leading edges for delamination and damage.

(d) Check tightening of bolts every 100 flight hours or six month
