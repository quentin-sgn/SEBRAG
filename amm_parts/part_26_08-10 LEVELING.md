### 08-10 LEVELING

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
Some operations related to maintenance or repairs require the aircraft to be leveled.
The aircraft may be leveled with jacks or by changing the tire inflation. To level the
aircraft, the cabin sills above main spar and canopy frame are used (Fig. 08--1).
Lateral and longitudinal leveling is checked using a spirit level. The aircraft should
be placed on a level surface, and should be protected from a wind (preferably
inside a hangar).

###### 2. MAINTENANCE PRACTICES

**A.** **Aircraft on jacks**
Type of maintenance: Line

Personnel qualification: Independent certifying staff qualified in accordance

with Part-66 or higher.

Recommended tools, materials, persons and documentation:

ITEM QUANTITY

Lift jack 3 pc

Stand 1 pc

Spirit level 1 pc

Persons 1

_Tab. 08-1 Recommended tools, materials, persons and documentation_

(1) Leveling:
(a) Lift the aircraft on jacks (Chapter 07-10).

(b) Open the canopy.

(c) Adjust the aircraft laterally leveled position by extending or retracting
of appropriate jacks. Check the lateral leveling by a spirit level placed
across the cabin sills above the main spar with the canopy opened
(Fig. 08-1). If the spirit level is not long enough, a suitable extension
(e.g. even wooden plank) may be used with the spirit level placed on
top. Be careful not to damage the cabin sills when leveling.

(d) Adjust the aircraft longitudinally leveled position by extending or
retracting of appropriate jacks. Check the longitudinal leveling by a
spirit level on the canopy frame (Fig. 08-1).

(e) Remove the spirit level and close the canopy.

(1) Leveling:
(a) Open the canopy.

(b) Adjust the aircraft laterally leveled position by deflating the
appropriate main wheels’ tire or install under main wheels suitable
pads. Check the lateral leveling by a spirit level placed across the
cabin sills above the main spar with the canopy opened (Fig. 08-1). If
the spirit level is not long enough, a suitable extension (e.g. even
wooden plank) may be used with the spirit level placed on top. Be
careful not to damage the cabin sills when leveling.

(c) Adjust the aircraft longitudinally leveled position by deflating the nose
wheel’s tire or install under nose wheel suitable pad. Check the
longitudinal leveling by a spirit level on the canopy frame
(Fig. 08-1).

(d) Remove the spirit level and close the canopy.

###### CAUTION

AFTER THE OPERATION ON THE LEVELED AIRCRAFT IS FINISHED,
INFLATE THE LANDING GEAR TIRES WITH PRESCRIBED PRESSURE
(Chapter 12-10).

**NOTE**

Deflate the tires slowly and in small steps - note with inertia of the system.
When deflating the tire, take care to avoid excessive deformation of the
tire. If the deflation of the nose wheel’s tire is not sufficient, install under
the main wheel the suitable pads.
