(a) Drain the fuel tanks (Chapter 12-10)

(b) Remove the adhesive sealing tape covering the gap between wing
and the wing central section.

(c) Under the wing central section, remove the cover (8, Chapter 06-00,
Fig. 06-2) by unscrewing bolts with washers.

(d) Disconnect aileron push rod by removing safety pin (9, Fig. 57-2),
unscrew the nut (7), remove the bolt (6) and washer (8).

###### CAUTION

BEFORE DISCONNECTING FLAP PUSH ROD, PROTECT
THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE WHEEL FAIRING AS THE
FLAP WILL FALL DOWN.

(e) Disconnect the wing flap lever by unscrewing the nut (15) and
removing the washer (16).

(f) Hold the wing flap; disconnect the wing flap push rod (13) by
removing the split pin (12) and pulling out the pin (11).

(g) Remove safety pins (5) securing wing pins. Pull out all wing's pins in
the following order: first outside main pin (1, Fig. 57-1) through the
installation hole, second auxiliary pin (3) and third inner main pin (2)
in the cockpit. During this procedure slightly move the wingtip up and
down to unload pins.

(h) Release hose clamps (Chapter 28-20) on the fuel hoses.

(i) Pull out the wing so that there is approximately 100 mm distance
between the wing central section and the wing root, unplug all hoses
and wires.

(j) Carefully remove the wing and put it on soft mats. Protect all fuel
tank sockets from contamination by foreign objects with an adhesive
tape. Stick the wires and hoses to the wing root rib using adhesive
