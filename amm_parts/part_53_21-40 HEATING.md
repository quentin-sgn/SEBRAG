### 21-40 HEATING

###### 1. DESCRIPTION

**A.** **Cockpit heating**
The preheat air is received from the deflector (1, Fig. 21-4) installed behind the
water radiator and directs through the air hose (2) to the exchanger (3) on the
muffler to be heated. Hot air from the exchanger directs through the air hose (4)
to the control box (5). Amount of warm air entering the cockpit is controlled by
the CABIN HEATING controller (6).
