### 34-50 DEPENDENT POSITION DETERMINING

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
This chapter covers that portion of the system which provides information to
determine position from sources which are mainly dependent on ground installations.
This includes the GNC 255A NAV / COMM, Garmin GTX 328 Transponder system,
and VOR/LOC antenna and transponder antenna.
The aircraft is equipped with Garmin GNC 255A NAV / COMM device
(Chapter 39-10). Garmin GNC 255A NAV / COMM consists of a transmitter / receiver
for VHF communication (COM) and a receiver for navigation information (NAV).
These are combined with operating controls in one unit. The COM section of the
GNC 255A NAV / COMM operates in the aviation voice band, from 118.000 to
136.975 MHz, in 25 kHz steps (default). For European operations, a Com radio
configuration of 8.33 kHz steps is also available. The NAV section operates from 108
MHz to 117.95 MHz decoding both the VHF Omni Range and Localizer navigation
signals. The built-in Glideslope receiver will automatically tune the corresponding
glideslope paired frequencies (328 MHz to 335 MHz) when the localizer is tuned.
The Garmin GTX 328 panel mounted Mode S transponder is a radio transmitter and
receiver that operates on radar frequencies, receiving ground radar or TCAS
interrogations at 1030 MHz and transmitting a coded response of pulses to ground
based radar on a frequency of 1090 MHz. The GTX 328 is equipped with IDENT
capability that activates the Special Position Identification (SPI) pulse for 18 seconds.
Mode S transmit/receive capability also requires 1090 MHz transmitting and 1030
MHz receiving for Mode S functions.
In addition to displaying the code, reply symbol and mode of operation, the GTX 328
screen will display pressure altitude, and timer functions. The unit also features an
altitude monitor, and flight timers. A voice or tone audio output announces altitude
deviation, and count down timer expiration.
The GTX 328 transponder (Chapter 39-10) is powered on by pressing the STBY,
ALT or ON keys. After power on a start-up page will be displayed while the unit
performs a self test.
