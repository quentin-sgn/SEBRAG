(1) Windshield removal:
(a) Remove canopy (Chapter 52-10).

(b) Remove vent windows (5.B.(1)).

(c) Use a grinding tool and a cut-off disk to cut out the inner portion of
the windshield to gain access to the bonding flange. The windshield
should be cut as close as possible to the canopy frame. Use care to
prevent damage to the canopy frame.

###### CAUTION

EXERCISE CARE TO PREVENT THE REMOVAL OF
LAMINATE FROM THE CANOPY FRAME WHEN CUTTING
AND REMOVING THE ADHESIVE FROM GAP BETWEEN
THE CANOPY FRAME AND WINDSHIELD. IF LAMINATE IS
DAMAGED, IT MUST BE REPAIRED PRIOR TO INSTALLING
THE NEW WINDSHIELD.

(d) Cut remainders of the windshield in a perpendicular direction to
around 10 cm strips (see Fig. 56-2).

(e) Cut adhesive from gap between canopy frame and windshield strips
using a small knife. While pushing on the windshield strips, follow the
edge of the canopy frame with the tip of the blade, then cut back
towards the canopy frame to remove adhesive. (see Fig. 56-2).

(f) Using a knife, isopropyl alcohol and sandpaper, remove all remaining
adhesive from the canopy frame bonding flange.

(2) Windshield installation:

###### CAUTION

EXERCISE CARE TO PROTECT THE INNER AND OUTER
WINDSHIELD SURFACES FROM DAMAGE DURING THE
INSTALLATION PROCESS.

(a) Inspect canopy frame bonding flange for any remaining adhesive or
contaminates, remove and clean if necessary.

(b) Cover the flight compartment and instrument panel with a foil to
prevent contamination.

(c) Fit the canopy frame on the fuselage (Chapter 52-10).

(d) Attach the cover foil to the windshield in the distance of 30 mm from
the edge of the windshield.

(e) Remove peel ply from bonding flange of the canopy frame (only if
new canopy frame is installed).

(f) Fit the windshield to the canopy frame and grind edges of the glass
so that between windshield and canopy frame remains equal gap of
2.5 mm (see Fig. 56-3).

(g) Using the tape, fix the windshield on the canopy frame. Inspect
the windshield for proper fit. The windshield must have equal gap of
2.5 mm around the perimeter of the windshield.

(h) Make several alignment marks around edges of masking tape on the
canopy frame and on masking tape on the windshield.

(i) Remove the windshield from the canopy frame and apply protective
tape on inner side of the windshield, which copies outer edge of
protective tape applied in previous step.

(j) Using sandpaper, abrade the bonding flange of the windshield and
canopy frame. Clean bonding surfaces from debris and dust. Apply a
continuous piece of a foam tape around the inner edge of the canopy
frame.

(k) Mix the adhesive in the rate of 250 g Swiftbond 9622 + 42 g
Swifthardener 9533. Thicken adhesive with cotton flakes (5 g) and
Aerosil (2 g) into the consistency of a paste and apply it on the
canopy bonding flange.

(l) Carefully place the windshield to the canopy frame and secure the
windshield into position making sure the alignment marks made
earlier (step h) are aligned and that the contour of the windshield
matches the contour of the canopy frame.

(m) Remove adhesive excesses from the gap and let the adhesive to

harden.

(n) After curing, remove adhesive excesses from the gap. Fill the gap
with epoxy mixture thickened with brown microballoons.

(o) Install vent windows (5.B.(1)).

foremost bolt to fix the stop plate (8). Do not tighten bolts yet.

(c) Insert springs (6) to holes in slider (5). Put such pre-assembled slider
along lower edge of vent window (2). Lug of vent window has to fit
into slider groove. Springs have to touch inner side of the vent
window.

(d) Carefully pull down pre-assembled vent window (2) along with slider
(5) and springs (6) into lower rail (4). Pay attention to proper window
orientation.

(e) Repeat step (c) to fit slider (5) to upper edge of vent window (2).

(f) Fix upper rail (3) to windshield (1) using bolts (7). Use foremost bolt
to fix the stop plate (8). Do not tighten bolts yet.

(g) Slide the vent window and check functionality.

(h) Finalize all bolts (7).

the side window to gain access to the bonding flange. The window
should be cut as close as possible to the fuselage flange. Use care to
prevent damage to the fuselage.

###### CAUTION

EXERCISE CARE TO PREVENT THE REMOVAL OF
LAMINATE FROM THE FUSELAGE FLANGE WHEN

CUTTING AND REMOVING THE ADHESIVE FROM GAP
BETWEEN THE FUSELAGE FLANGE AND SIDE WINDOW. IF
LAMINATE IS DAMAGED, IT MUST BE REPAIRED PRIOR TO
INSTALLING THE NEW SIDE WINDOW.

(b) Cut remainders of the side window in a perpendicular direction to
around 10 cm strips (see Fig. 56-5).

(c) Cut adhesive from gap between the fuselage flange and side window
strips using a small knife. While pushing on the window strips, follow

(2) Side window installation:

###### CAUTION

EXERCISE CARE TO PROTECT THE INNER AND OUTER
SIDE OF THE SIDE WINDOW SURFACES FROM DAMAGE
DURING THE INSTALLATION PROCESS.

(a) Inspect fuselage bonding flange for any remaining adhesive or
contaminates, remove and clean if necessary.

(b) Cover the interior with a foil to prevent contamination.

(c) Attach the cover foil to the side window in the distance of 30 mm
from the edge of the window.

(d) Fit the window to the fuselage and grind edges of the glass so that
between window and fuselage remains equal gap of 2.5 mm (see
Fig. 56-6).

(e) Using the tape, fix the window on the fuselage. Inspect the window
for proper fit. The windshield must have equal gap of 2.5 mm around
the perimeter of the windshield.

(f) Make several alignment marks around edges of masking tape on the
fuselage and on masking tape on the window.

(g) Remove the window from the fuselage and apply protective tape on
inner side of the window, which copies outer edge of protective tape
applied in previous step.

(h) Using sandpaper, abrade the bonding flange of the side window and
fuselage. Clean bonding surfaces from debris and dust. Apply a
continuous piece of a foam tape around the inner edge of the
fuselage.

(i) Mix the adhesive in the rate of 100 g Swiftbond 9622 + 17 g
Swifthardener 9533. Thicken adhesive with cotton flakes (3 g) and
Aerosil (1 g) into the consistency of a paste and apply it on the
