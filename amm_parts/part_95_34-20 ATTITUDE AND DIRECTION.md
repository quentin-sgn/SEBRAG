### 34-20 ATTITUDE AND DIRECTION

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
This chapter contains information pertaining to those portions of the system which
use magnetic, gyroscopic, and inertia forces. Included is the Dynon SkyView system,
magnetic compass and standby bank indicator.
Dynon SkyView system is the next generation of glass panel avionics for light sport
aircrafts. The system architecture is shown on Fig. 34-8.
The SV-D1000 displays are very bright, high-resolution screens and contain the main
control CPU, graphics processor, and terrain data-base. Displays can act as a
Primary Flight Display (PFD) with Synthetic Vision, an Engine Monitoring System
(EMS), and a Moving Map in a variety of screen layouts.
The most used functions are accessed via two rotary/multi-direction joysticks. Almost
all other in flight commands are all available via eight buttons.
Every SkyView system display and module is connected by two independent power
and data buses. The failure of any bus connection or module results in an automatic
switch to a working bus or module.
Two SV-BAT-320 Backup Batteries provides over an hour of backup power to display
and connected modules (see Chapter 24-30).
SV-EMS-220 engine module measures engine parameters - engine speed, manifold
pressure, oil temperature and pressure, exhaust gas temperature, coolant
temperature, fuel quantity, voltage, current, fuel pressure and fuel flow
(see Chapter 77-10).
The SV-ADAHRS-200 is a complete MEMS-based attitude reference and air data
computer, integrated with a digital compass. This allows easier mounting and higher
accuracy calibration between the system components.
NMEA compatible GPS antenna, mounted inside the fuselage under the left part of
the instrument panel (Chapter 34-50), is connected to the SkyView system.
Convenient program and data updates are realised via USB memory stick.

**NOTE**

Refer to “Dynon Avionics SkyView System Installation, Document 101320022, Revision Q” or later for additional information.

The magnetic compass, mounted to the fuselage above the windshield, contains a
circular compass card, visible through the compass case window, suspended in
alcohol solution. The compass is equipped with compensating magnets and has two
adjusting set bolts, one for North-South adjustment and one for East-West
adjustment. These set bolts are located behind the access plate on face of the
compass.
Standby bank indicator is mounted on the left instrument panel.
