**INTRODUCTION**

When performing maintenance, the safety must be always considered. Always use
proper personal protective equipment, at least but not limited to:

     - Wear protective gloves when handling with chemicals and sealants. Do
not use protective hand creams as they can contaminate the sealants and
surfaces.

     - Wear goggles, safety glasses or face shield for eye protection.

     - Do not wear loose clothing and secure long hair to prevent them from
becoming tangled in power tools.

     - Wear ear plugs or muffs to protect your ears.

     - Wear suitable protective shoes with non-slip soles.

Prior to performing maintenance or repair consider following general rules:

     - Check that emergency parachute system actuator is locked.

     - Check that MASTER SWITCH and IGNITION is set OFF.

     - Disconnect the negative terminal from the battery.

     - Remove all jewelry. It can conduct electricity and may cause a short circuit
or can be caught in rotating tools.

     - When working with the fuel and fuel system, always work in a well
ventilated place. Always ground the airframe during fueling/defueling to
avoid risk of fire due to static discharge. Do not manipulate with open
flame and keep all ignition sources away.

     - When working with a landing gear, properly support the aircraft with jacks.
Do not work under aircraft unless it is properly supported.

     - While the engine is running, keep away from the propeller.
