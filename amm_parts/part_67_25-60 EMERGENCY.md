### 25-60 EMERGENCY

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
The aircraft is equipped with emergency parachute system (EPS) MAGNUM 601
S-LSA from the company STRATOS 07 spol. s r. o.
Parachute container (1, Fig. 25-5) is located behind instrument panel and is attached
to the board. Two main straps (3) are attached to the stiffened areas at firewall and
stabilizing strap is attached to the steel cable (5) (bonded in the structure of right
fuselage shell). Main and stabilizing straps are through a carabine attached to the
parachute strap.
Extraction device (rocket) (2) is attached in the laminate holders that are bonded to
the firewall. It is connected with the parachute extraction cable. Rocket is connected
to an actuator (4) installed at the central console by a Bowden cable. Actuator is
secured by protector of EPS actuator from unintentional activation of rocket.

**NOTE**

For more details refer to “MANUAL FOR MOUNTING AND USE OF RESCUE
BALLISTIC PARACHUTE SYSTEMS SERIES MAGNUM”, latest issue.

The aircraft is equipped with KANNAD 406 AF COMPACT ELT.
The KANNAD 406 AF COMPACT is a FAA TSO’d approved, EASA ETSO’d
approved, 406 MHz, Automatic Fixed (AF) Emergency Locator Transmitter. The ELT
KANNAD 406 AF COMPACT can be activated either automatically when the crash
occurs (by a shock sensor) or manually (by a switch on the transmitter itself or on a
remote control unit on the instrument panel). The ELT transmits emergency signals
on two frequencies:

   - 406 MHz (Cospas-Sarsat frequency) for precise pinpointing and identification of
the aircraft,

   - 121.5 MHz used for homing in the final stages of the rescue operations.

The energy to the units is provided by a battery pack composed of a LiMnO2
twoelement battery. Until the battery expiry date, the duration of the 121.5 MHz
transmission is over 48 hours at -20°C. As it is therefore preferable to keep the
battery power for 121.5 MHz homing frequency transmission for the rescue
operations, in compliance with Cospas-Sarsat specifications, the 406 MHz
transmission is deliberately stopped after 24 hours to extend the 121.5 MHz
transmission for as long as possible.
The ELT KANNAD 406 AF COMPACT consists of the unit (6, Fig. 25-5) which is
installed in the baggage compartment and the remote control panel which is installed
on the right side of the instrument panel. The external antenna (7) is installed on the
bracket on the left part of the fuselage behind the baggage compartment and is
accessible through a baggage bulkhead cover access panel at the base of the
baggage compartment bulkhead.
Wiring diagram of ELT´s are described in the Aircraft Wiring Manual
(Doc. No. AS-AWM-01-000).
