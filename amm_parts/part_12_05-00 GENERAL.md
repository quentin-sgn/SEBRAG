### 05-00 GENERAL

###### 1. INTRODUCTION
This chapter includes the aircraft manufacturer's recommended time limits, maintenance checks and inspections (both scheduled and unscheduled).
Recommended intervals for items inspection are based on normal usage under average environmental conditions.

###### 2. SPECIAL CONDITIONS
All inspection intervals for scheduled maintenance checks, replacement and overhaul
schedule and special inspections schedule noted in this manual are based on average usage and average environmental conditions. Aircrafts operated in abnormal environments (i.e. tropic, humid or cold climates, i.e. dusty and salt-water environment,
etc.) may be worn, corroded, etc. more. Operation in abnormal environments can influence inspections, overhauls, lubrication, etc. frequency.
In these areas, periodic inspections should be performed in shortened inspection periods based on operator’s experiences.

###### 3. DEFINITIONS

**100-HOUR INSPECTION**
Same as an annual condition inspection, except the interval of inspection is 100 h of
operation instead of 12 calendar months. This inspection is utilized when the LSA is
being used for commercial operations such as flight instruction or rental, or both

**ANNUAL CONDITION INSPECTION**
Detailed inspection accomplished once a year on a LSA in accordance with instructions provided in the maintenance manual supplied with the aircraft. The purpose of
the inspection is to look for any wear, corrosion, or damage that would cause an aircraft to not be in a condition for safe operation.

**CALENDAR TIME**
The time from the date on the original airworthiness certificate issued with each new
aircraft, to be used as the basis for determination of all maintenance, TBO or replacement intervals.

**CONDITION**
lnspection for, but not limited to, cleanliness, cracks, deformation, corrosion, wear,
and loose or missing fasteners.

**CORROSION**
Pitting, or a surface breakdown of a material due to chemical or electro-chemical attack by atmosphere, moisture or other agents.

**DAMAGED**
Rendered unusable for its intended purpose.

**FAA**
United States Federal Aviation Administration.

**PERIODIC INSPECTIONS**


-----

**PERIODIC INSPECTIONS**

**FLIGHT TIME / FLIGHT HOURS**
The time in service from the moment the aircraft leaves the ground until it touches
the ground at the end of the flight.

**FUNCTIONAL INSPECTION**
It is a quantitative inspection to determine if one or more functions of an item performs within specified limits. The function inspection is a comparative examination of
a system or an item against specific standard.

**HEAVY MAINTENANCE**
Any maintenance, inspection, repair, or alteration a manufacturer has designated that
requires specialized training, equipment, or facilities.

**INSPECTION**
An examination of an item.

**ITEM**
Any component or its sets of parts (including the components itself) isolated as an
entity for inspection.

**LINE MAINTENANCE**
Any repair, maintenance, scheduled checks, servicing, inspections, or alterations not
considered heavy maintenance that is approved by the manufacturer and is specified
in the manufacturer’s maintenance manual.

**LSA REPAIRMAN MAINTENANCE**
U.S. FAA-certificated repairman (light sport aircraft) with a maintenance rating as defined by 14 CFR Part 65, authorized to perform line maintenance on aircraft certificated as special LSA aircraft. Authorized to perform the annual condition/100-h inspection on an LSA, or an equivalent rating issued by other civil aviation authorities.

**MAINTENANCE MANUAL(S)**
Manual provided by an LSA manufacturer or supplier that specifies all maintenance,
repairs, and alterations authorized by the manufacturer.

**MAINTENANCE**
Means inspection, overhaul, repair, preservations and the replacement of parts, but
excludes preventive maintenance.

**MAJOR REPAIR, ALTERATION, OR MAINTENANCE**
Any repair, alteration, or maintenance for which instructions to complete the task excluded from the maintenance manual(s) supplied to the consumer are considered
major.

**MANUFACTURER**
Any entity engaged in the production of an LSA or component used on an LSA.

**MINOR REPAIR, ALTERATION, OR MAINTENANCE**
Any repair, alteration, or maintenance for which instructions provided for in the
maintenance manual(s) supplied to the consumer of the product are considered minor.

**PERIODIC INSPECTIONS**


-----

**PERIODIC INSPECTIONS**

**ON CONDITION**
The necessary inspections and/or checks to determine that a malfunction or failure
will not occur prior to the next scheduled inspection.

**OPERATING HOURS OF ENGINE**
The time in service when the engine is running irrespective of the load factor of the
engine, such as idling or takeoff power.

**OPERATIONAL INSPECTION**
The purpose of operational inspection is to determine that a system or an item is operable. This inspection requires no special equipment. The operational inspection is
comparable to the inspection performed out by the flight crew. The purpose of the
operational inspection is to determine that an item is fulfilling its intended purpose. It
does not require quantitative tolerances. This is a failure finding task.

**OVERHAUL**
Maintenance, inspection, repair, or alterations that are only to be accomplished by
the original manufacturer or a facility approved by the original manufacturer of the
product.

**SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE**
Preventative maintenance tasks scheduled to be accomplished at specified intervals.

**SPECIAL INSPECTION**
lnspection of components or systems based on calendar time, hours or cycles which
does not coincide with the scheduled inspection.

**UNSCHEDULED MAINTENANCE**
Inspections and checks for damage after operating the aircraft in conditions which
could require unscheduled maintenance, i.e. hard landing, etc.

**VISUAL INSPECTION**
An observation to determine that item is fulfilling its intended purpose. Visual inspection criteria can be accomplished without disassembly or removal of adjacent equipment. It does not require quantitative tolerances. This is a failure finding task.

**WEAR**
Material or part consumed as a result of exposure to operation or usage.
