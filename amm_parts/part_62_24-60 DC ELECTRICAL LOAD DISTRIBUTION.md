### 24-60 DC ELECTRICAL LOAD DISTRIBUTION

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
The electrical power from the generator and the battery is supplied via 12 V bus,
switches and circuit breakers to the individual electrical equipment.
Switches are installed at the lower edge of instrument panel’s left side.
Circuit breakers are installed at the lower edge of instrument panel’s right side.
Circuit breakers markings and values are listed in the Table 24-5.
Dual contactless ignition of the engine it is a separate part of electrical installation.
Each ignition circuit can be switched off independently using corresponding
**IGNITION switch (see Chapter 74-30). Ignition box STARTER is connected to the**
battery through a MASTER SWITCH.
Pitch and roll trim actuators are activated by separate switches and are connected
through PITCH and ROLL circuit breakers to the MASTER SWITCH.
Avionics (COMM/NAV, XPDR, intercom, and traffic sensor) are activated by separate
**AVIONICS switch and are connected through AVIONICS circuit breaker to the**
avionic relay and then to the master switch.are connected through circuit breaker to
the MASTER SWITCH. COMM/NAV, XPDR and intercom have a separate COMM,
**NAV, XPDR and INTERCOM circuit breakers.**
Fuel pump is activated by separate FUEL PUMP switch and is connected through a
**FUEL PUMP circuit breaker to the INST. position of STARTER ignition box.**
SV D1000 PFD and MFD displays are connected through LH D1000 and LH D1000
circuit breakers directly to the MASTER SWITCH.
Low oil pressure warning circuit and low fuel level warning circuit have a separate
**OIL PRESS and FUEL RES. circuit breakers.**
12 V sockets of an automotive type are installed at the both lower corners of
instrument panel and are connected through SOC. 12V circuit breaker to the
**MASTER SWITCH.**
Engine hours and flight hours are supplied through SVI circuit breaker from the INST.
position of STARTER ignition box.
The TRX-1500 collision avoidance system unit is connected through PCAS circuit
breaker to the MASTER SWITCH.
Navigation and anti-collision lights are activated by NAV/ACL switch and are
connected through NAV / ACL circuit breaker to the MASTER SWITCH.
Landing lights are activated by LAND switch and are connected through LAND
circuit breaker to the MASTER SWITCH.
ELT has its own battery for power supply.
