### 31-30 RECORDERS

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
The aircraft is equipped with the flying hours counter and engine operated Hobbs
hours meter.
The Winter FSMZ flying hours counter has an electrically driven counter mechanism
and the readings are in hours and minutes. It is connected to the aircraft's total
pressure sensor and automatically switches on when the airspeed reaches 32 kts
(60 km/h). This ensures that the actual flight time only is recorded, while secondary
times for takeoff and landing are ignored.
Hobbs meter is a device used to measure the engine running time. The meter
displays hours and tenths of an hour. The meter is activated from the starter ignition
box.
