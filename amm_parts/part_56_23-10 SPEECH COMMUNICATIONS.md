### 23-10 SPEECH COMMUNICATIONS

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
The aircraft is equipped with Garmin GNC 255A NAV / COMM device. Garmin GNC
255A NAV / COMM (Fig. 23-1) consists of transmitter / receiver for VHF
communication (COM) and receiver for navigation information (NAV). These are
combined with operating controls in one unit. The COM section of the GNC 255A
NAV / COMM operates in the aviation voice band, from 118.000 to 136.975 MHz, in
25 kHz and 8.33 kHz steps. The NAV section operates from 108 MHz to 117.95 MHz
decoding both the VHF Omni Range and Localizer navigation signals. The built-in
Glideslope receiver will automatically tune the corresponding glideslope paired
frequencies (328 MHz to 335 MHz) when the localizer is tuned (Chapter 34-50).
Garmin GNC 255A NAV / COMM device is located on the centre section of the
instrument panel (Chapter 39-10) and is connected with the COMM and NAV
antenna and PM3000 intercom.
