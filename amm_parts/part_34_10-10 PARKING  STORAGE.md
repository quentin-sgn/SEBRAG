### 10-10 PARKING / STORAGE

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
Parking procedure depends on parking time (or on expected weather conditions).
If adverse weather conditions are expected (very strong wind, downpours, sand
storm etc.), the aircraft should be parked inside a hangar. When parking inside the
hangar, carry out the same operations as during a short-time parking.
When parking on a surface without sufficient loading capacity, e.g. asphalt surface at
high temperatures or wet soft surface, there is a danger that wheels will sink into the
surface. Park the aircraft on a hard surface of the apron where mooring equipment is
built in. Do not park on a surface with insufficient loading capacity.
Storage procedure is intended to protect the aircraft, if removal from service is
assumed. The main aim is to prevent from corrosion and damage of aircraft parts
exposed to weather.
Depending on the time after which the aircraft will remain inactive, the storage is
divided on:

   - temporary storage (30 to 90 days)

   - long term storage (over 91 days).
If possible, park the aircraft in a hangar.
