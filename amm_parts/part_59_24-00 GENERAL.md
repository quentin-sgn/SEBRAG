### 24-00 GENERAL

###### 1. INTRODUCTION
The information in this chapter covers DC generation, external power, and electrical
load distribution.
This aircraft is equipped with a dual-wire type electrical system. The system has two
sources of electrical power - generator and 12 volt battery. A generator integrated
into the engine and connected to a rectifier/voltage regulator supplies power to the
electrical system. A 12 V / 17 Ah battery is charged by the generator and supplies
power for starting the engine and for equipment while the engine is not running.
Two SV-BAT-320 backup batteries provides of backup power to SkyView system
displays and modules.
The electrical circuits of the system are, with the exception of the engine start circuit,
protected by automatic circuit breakers. Figure 24-1 shows a simplified schematic
diagram of the electrical system. For detailed wiring diagrams refer to Aircraft Wiring
Manual (Doc. No. AS-AWM-01-000).
