### 28-20 DISTRIBUTION

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
Fuel is supplied to the engine in dependence from FUEL selector valve position
(LEFT - RIGHT - OFF). From both fuel tanks, the fuel flows through the fuel strainers
and fuel filters to the FUEL selector valve inlets.
From the FUEL selector valve the fuel flows through the electric fuel pump (bypassed with check valve) to engine driven fuel pump and then to distributor inlet.
One of distributor's outlets is connected to carburettors through the fuel flow meter
sensor and 3-way distributor. Fuel flow transducer is installed the way to measure
only the fuel consumed by engine. Second one is fitted with restrictor jet to which
return line is connected. Return line leads back to the left fuel tank.
Fuel pressure sensor and standby fuel pressure indicator are installed in the fuel
system and connected through the 3-way distributor with restrictor jets in its outlets to
the 4-way distributor. Both check the actual pressure in the fuel supply line.
Wing fuel tanks are ventilated from the highest point through the pipe inside of
fuselage wing tanks and discharge through the hoses which exit through the lower
fuselage skin in the central tunnel in front of main spar.
Scheme of fuel system is shown at Fig. 28-1.
Fuel lines in the engine compartment are protected with a fire pyro jacket covering.
Fuel lines are fixed to avoid wear from vibrations.
