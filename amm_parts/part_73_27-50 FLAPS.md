### 27-50 FLAPS

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
The wing flaps are operated manually by a lever (1, Fig. 27-16) on the pedestal panel
between pilot and co-pilot. Wing flaps lever moves in the slotted link (2) that
determinates four positions:
**FLAPS 0 - Retracted (0°),**
**FLAPS 1 - Take-off position (15°),**
**FLAPS 2 - Mid-position (24°),**
**FLAPS 3 - Fully extended position (35°).**
Movements from wing flap lever are transferred through the push-pull rod 1 (3) and
bellcrank (4) to the flap's torsion tube (5). Flap’s torsion tube is fixed in three sliding
bearings (6) which are attached to the central section auxiliary spar (middle bearing)
and outer ribs (left and right bearing). It makes mechanical interconnection between
left and right wing flap. Torsion tube is connected with the wing flap lever (7) by
means of push-pull rods (8) with fork at the one and adjustable bearing end at the
other one. Wing flap lever is fixed at the wing flap (9).
Gas strut (10) installed in the flap control system reduces pilot’s operating force
during extending/retracting of wing flaps. The gas strut is located in the baggage
compartment and attached to the central tunnel and flap’s torsion tube. It is protected
by laminate cover (Chapter 06-00, Fig. 06-3).
The pedestal panel (2, Fig. 27-16) is attached on top of central tunnel between seats.
On the pedestal panel are located: brake lever, wing flap lever and trim switches.
Under the cover in the central tunnel are the elevator and wing flap push rods, rudder
control cables, brake system, electrical wires, etc.

(2) Flap control system installation:
(a) Before installation check main parts for cracks and condition of rivets
on push rod.

(b) Carefully rotate and slide torsion tube (1, Fig. 27-18) from right side
of centre section wing root through all holes to other side (wings have
to be removed).

(c) Put all sliding bearings (6) on torsion tube (1) and attach them (1; 6)
on middle insert and sides carbon holders, by using bolts (5; 9),
washers (13; 14; 15) and nuts (11).

**NOTE**

Tighten nuts (11) so that the torsion tube (1) rotates easily.

(d) Stick cover on centre section roots with silicone (remove old
silicone).

(e) Connect bellcrank (2) to torsion tube (1), by using bolt (8), washer
(13) and nut (11).

(f) Install push rod and pedestal panel (Chapter 27-50, 2.B.(2)).

(g) In right baggage compartment attach gas strut (18) to torsion tube
lever and ball joint.

**CAUTION**

GAS STRUT HAS TO BE ORIENTED WITH VALVE SIDE UP
AND PISTON ROD DOWN.

(h) Install gas strut cover.

(i) Attach covers of torsion tube.

(j) Install wings (Chapter 57-10).

(k) Connect push rod (3) to torsion tube (1), by using bolt (7), washer
(13) and nut (12).

(l) Connect push rod (3) to wing flap hinge, by using pin (4) and cotter
pin (17). If using new push rod(s) (3):

           - Set wing flap lever to position 0 (flaps retracted).

           - Flap trailing edges must be aligned with centre section trailing

edge (a preload is created in the wing flap control system).

            - If previous point isn´t not fulfilled, disconnect pin (4), release lock

nut (10) and screw push rod (3) to adjust to correct length.
Replace washer (16) and tighten lock nut (10); check rod end in
safety.

           - Secure pin (4) with cotter pin (17).

(m) Connect second push rod (3).
