### 76-10 POWER CONTROL

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
Engine power is set using the throttle control (1, Fig. 76-1) from idle up to max.
power. A bowden cables connect between the throttle control in the cockpit and the
carburetors on the engine. The THROTTLE control is a black knob installed in the
central console. It is configured so that the max. power is open in the forward position
and idle in the full aft position. Throttle control is operated by rotating the knob in
clockwise direction for increase or counter clockwise for decrease of engine power.
For rapid or large adjustments the knob may be moved forward or aft by depressing
the lock button in the end of the throttle control and then positioning the throttle
control as desired.
The bowden cable goes from the central console through the firewall to the engine
compartment and to the carburetors.

Engine fuel mixture during engine starting is controlled by the choke control (2). The
**CHOKE control is a grey round knob located in the central console. The rich mixture**
is full aft and the weak mixture is full forward position of choke knob.
