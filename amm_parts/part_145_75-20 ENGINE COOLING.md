### 75-20 ENGINE COOLING

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
Engine has combined air and water cooling system.
Water cooling system consists of water thermostat (5, Fig. 75-1) and water radiator
(3) through which the coolant flows to the water pump (4) and then is distributed to
the water-cooled engine parts inside of engine. Water radiator (3) is attached in the
holder fixed in the middle of lower engine cowling. Overflow bottle (2) is attached at
firewall and connected by a hose with the expansion tank (1). Expansion tank located
on top of the engine allows coolant expansion. The overflow bottle accumulates the
coolant in the case of engine overheating.
Cooling air is received through the two upper engine cowling intakes and is baffled to
the engine compartment.
The coolant temperature sensor (6) is located in the tube between expansion tank
and water thermostat (Chapter 77).
The cylinder head temperature sensor is installed at the cylinder head of right rear
cylinder (in flight direction). This system allows for accurate measurement of engine
temperature, even in event of fluid loss (Chapter 77).
Total coolant volume is about 2.5 liters. Information about used coolant by
manufacturer is recorded on a placard at firewall in the engine compartment.
Maintenance practices and procedures concerning coolant volume
check/replenishing and coolant change are mentioned in Chapter 12-10.

**NOTE**

Recommended coolants are mentioned in the Operators Manual for Rotax
Engine Type 912/914 Series, Ref. No.: OM-912/914.
