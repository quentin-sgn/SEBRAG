###### 1. INTRODUCTION
Fuel is supplied to the engine in dependence from fuel selector position (LEFT **RIGHT - OFF) (22, Fig. 28-1). From fuel tanks (16; 17; 18; 19) the fuel flows through**
the fuel strainers (23) and fuel filters (21) to the fuel selector (22) inlets. From the fuel
selector the fuel flows through the electric fuel pump (12) with the by-pass check
valve (13) to engine driven fuel pump (1) and then to distributor inlet (4). One of
distributor's outlets is connected to carburettors (2; 3) through the fuel flow
transducer (7) and 3-way distributor (5). Fuel flow transducer is installed the way to
measure only the fuel consumed by engine. Second one is fitted with restrictor jet (6)
to which return line is connected. Return line leads back to the left fuel tank (17).
Right wing fuel tanks (16; 19) are connected with the fuselage wing tanks (17; 18)
using simple hose connection with clamps. Fuel tanks are vented from the highest
point and discharge through the hoses protruding under aircraft through the fuselage
skin inside of central tunnel.
There is fuel level sensor (15) in the both left and right fuel tank. Fuel level sensor is
installed in the root rib of fuselage fuel tanks. Signal from the fuel level sensor is
carried to the engine monitoring system unit Dynon SV-EMS 220 (8) and from there
to the Dynon SkyView SV-D1000 (10).
Fuel pressure sensor (9) and standby fuel pressure indicator (11) are installed in the
fuel system and connected through the 3-way distributor (5) with restrictor jets in its
outlets to the 4-way distributor (4). Both check the actual pressure in the fuel supply
line. Signal from the fuel pressure sensor is carried to the engine monitoring system
unit Dynon EMS 220 (8) and from there to the Dynon SkyView SV-D1000 (10).
Exceeding of fuel pressure limit value is signalized by red warning lamp EMS on the
instrument panel (Chapter 39).
Wiring diagram of fuel system components is described in the Aircraft Wiring Manual
(Doc. No. AS-AWM-01-000).
