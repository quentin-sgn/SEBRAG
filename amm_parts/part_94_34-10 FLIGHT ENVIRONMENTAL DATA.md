### 34-10 FLIGHT ENVIRONMENTAL DATA

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
Arrangement and scheme of the pitot-static system is given on the Fig. 34-1.
The Pitot-static probe (1) is installed under the right wing. It receives total pressure
(hoses marked “P”), static pressure (hoses marked “S”) and is equipped with AOA
sensing (hoses marked “A”).
Pressure distribution to individual instruments on the airspeed indicator (3), altimeter
(4), vertical speed indicator (5) expansion bottle (8), flight hours counter (6), altitude
encoder (7), ADAHRS module (2) and stall warning transducer (9) (Chapter 31-50) in
the cockpit is performed through the flexible plastic hoses. There are also three drain
sumps (9) included in the pitot-static system.

**NOTE**

ADAHRS module is a part of the Dynon SkyView system, which is described in
Chapter 34-20.

Test the pitot-static system tightness using the DPST-3500M testing
device (or similar). Carry out the test at the scheduled maintenance
periods or after each disconnection of the pitot-static system.
The allowed ranges of the measuring devices must not be exceeded
during the measurement.
The measurement must be performed in accordance with the instructions
and limitations stated in the handbooks of the DPST-3500M, Dynon
SkyView and other devices (vertical speed indicator, altimeter, airspeed
indicator).

(2) Pitot-static system leak test preparation:
a) Verify the correct function of the DPST-3500M testing device (before
each measurement) by the following procedure:

b) Plug the total pressure hose “P” from the pitot-static probe adapter
(2, Fig. 34-6) into the total pressure input on the DPST-3500M testing
device (9, Fig. 34-7) and the static pressure hose “S” from the pitotstatic probe adapter (2, Fig. 34-6) into the static pressure input on the
testing device (8, Fig. 34-7).

c) Attach the pitot-static probe adapter (2, Fig. 34-6) to the tested pitotstatic probe (3), so that the static and total pressure receivers are
properly sealed (depressurized during the measurement).

d) Verify the sealing and attachment of the pitot-static probe adapter
(2), and perform a pitot-static system leak test (see 3.J).

(3) Pitot-static system leak test:
a) Set the onboard altimeters to the reference pressure 1013.3 mbar
(29.92 inHg).

b) Monitor the values displayed on the DPST-3500M testing device.
Slowly adjust the altitude on the display (3) to the 4 000 ft.

c) Monitor the values displayed on the DPST-3500M testing device.
Slowly adjust the airspeed on the display (3) to the: 150 kts.

d) After stabilization of the indicators monitor the altitude and airspeed
for 60 seconds.

e) After 60 seconds the altitude decrease must not be more than 50 ft
and airspeed decrease must not be more than 3 kts.

f) Depressurize the system and disconnect test device.
