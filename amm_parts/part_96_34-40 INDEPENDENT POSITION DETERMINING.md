### 34-40 INDEPENDENT POSITION DETERMINING

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
This chapter covers that portion of the system that provides information to determine
position from sources that are mainly independent of ground installations. This
includes the GPS and TRX-1500 traffic sensor.
GPS signals are received by an SV-GPS-250 antenna mounted inside the fuselage
under the left part of the instrument panel (Fig. 34-12), which is connected to the
SkyView system.
The TRX-1500 traffic sensor combines a high performance ADS-B receiver with an
integral FLARM module. FLARM is a very popular collision avoidance system for
general aviation and gliders, which monitors airspace around aircraft. GPS signals
are received by a TRX GPS antenna mounted inside the fuselage under the right part
of the instrument panel (Fig. 34-12).
FLARM and ADS-B antennas are attached on the bottom side of the instrument
panel cover (Fig. 34-9).

**NOTE**

Refer to TRX-1500 ADS-B / FLARM Traffic sensor, User Manual Installation
Manual, Revision: 1.0a, 31 Jan. 2012 or later for additional information.
