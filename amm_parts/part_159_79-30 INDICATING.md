### 79-30 INDICATING

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
The oil temperature sensor (8, Fig. 79-1) for reading of the oil inlet temperature is
screwed into the oil pump housing. Signal from the sensor is carried to the engine
monitoring system unit Dynon EMS 220 (Chapter 77-40) and from there to the Dynon
SkyView SV-D1000 (Chapter 39-10).
The oil pressure sensor (2) is screwed into the crankcase on the right side of engine.
Signal from the sensor is carried to the engine monitoring system unit Dynon EMS
220 (Chapter 77-40) via low value warning unit (Chapter 31-50) and from there to the
Dynon SkyView SV-D1000. Low oil pressure (less than 2 bar / 29 psi) is signalized
with the OIL PRESS warning lamp (Chapter 39-10) controlled by low value warning
unit.
Wiring diagram of sensors connection is described in the Aircraft Wiring Manual
(Doc. No. AS-AWM-01-000).
