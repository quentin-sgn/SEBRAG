###### 2. MAINTENANCE PRACTICES

**A.** **Fuel system**
Integral fuel tanks are located in wings and wing central section in front of main
spar. Wing and wing central section tanks are interconnected with hose. Fuel
tank cap is located on the top surface of the wing. Drain valves are placed in the
lowest point of each tank on bottom surface of wings and fuselage (Fig. 12-2).
Fuel tanks capacities are shown in Tab. 12-3.

The fuels can contain dissolved and suspended water. The quantity of water in
the fuel depends upon the temperature and type of fuel. The suspended water is
settled on the bottom of fuel tanks. Dissolved water dispersed in fuel cannot be
filtered from the fuel by a fuel filter, which is able to catch only microscopic
solid particles.
The risk of operation with a contaminated fuel can be reduced by:

     - Keeping the fuel servicing equipment and filters of such equipment clean

     - Proper storage of the fuel

     - Regular drainage (prior to drainage, let the fuel in calm position for a
sufficient period of time for impurities and suspended water to settle down)

     - Regular watching for signs of fuel contamination e.g. fuel filter element
condition, fuel drain sample, visual check of the tank inside etc.

The following safety information should be followed at refueling/defueling,
drainage, and another fuel handling:
