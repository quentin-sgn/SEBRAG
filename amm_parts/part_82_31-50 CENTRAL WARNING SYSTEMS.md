### 31-50 CENTRAL WARNING SYSTEMS

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
The aircraft is equipped with the Low Value Warning (LVW) system for oil quantity
and fuel quantity. The system triggers a warning indicated by the warning lamps
when the oil or fuel quantity decreases below the critical level.
Stall Warning System consists of two independent stall warning sensors. The first
sensor is the Stall Warning Port (AoA port) located on the pitot-static probe (1,
Chapter 34-10, Fig. 34-1). The second sensor is ACI stall warner (1, Fig. 31-1)
installed on the left wing leading edge.
ACI stall warner (1) is connected to stall warning transducer (2) and triggers the
control stick shaker (4), buzzer (3) and stall warning lamp (8).
Stall warning transducer (2) is connected to the pitot-static system and triggers
buzzer (3) and stall warning lamp (8).
EFIS transducer (ADAHRS module (5)) is connected to the pitot-static system and
triggers visual signalization on the Dynon screens (6; 7) and aural indication in the
headset.
The each stall warning sub-system is adjusted to start the warning within the range
9-19 km/h (5-10 kts) before stalling. Scheme of stall warning system is shown on
Fig. 31-2.

Stall warning system has following indication of imminent stall:

   - Visual indication:
`o` Indicator on the EFIS screen (Dynon SkyView D1000)

`o` Stall warning light on the instrument panel

   - Aural indication:
`o` Headset sound (Dynon SkyView D1000)

`o` Buzzer

   - Tactile indication:
`o` Control stick shaker consists of motor with the eccentric mass installed in
the left control stick handle

The aircraft equipped with the test button (see Chapter 39-10) for ground test of stall
warning indication. Test button activates:

   - Stall warning light on the instrument panel

   - Buzzer

   - Control stick shaker
