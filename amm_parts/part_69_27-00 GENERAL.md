###### 1. INTRODUCTION
This chapter describes operation and the adjustment of the flight controls. It also
describes the assembly of the flight controls. Refer to the related chapter for the data
on a specified system.
The aircraft is equipped with dual control systems for elevator, ailerons and rudder.

###### 2. MAINTENANCE PRACTICES

**A.** **General principles**

**WARNING**

**FOR CONNECTING THE ROTARY-MOVABLE PARTS OF THE FLIGHT**
**CONTROLS, THE SELF-LOCKING NUTS ARE PROHIBITED TO BE**
**USED.**

**AT INSTALLATION USE ALWAYS NEW AND UNDAMAGED LOCKING**
**ELEMENTS (COTTER PINS, LOCK WASHERS, SELF-LOCKING NUTS,**
**etc.).**

At removals / installations adhere to general principles which are applicable to
all flight controls:
All bearings, ground surfaces of bolts and other moving parts of the flight
controls have to be greased (Chapter 12-20).
Friction surfaces of the ball joint bearings and sliding bearings have to be
lubricated before installation (Chapter 12-20).
Threaded parts of adjustable bearing ends and forks of all control push-pull rods
have to be screwed-in so that they cover the check holes in control pull rods
ends. So the minimum length of bearing end or fork threaded parts screwing in
the control pull rods, i.e. min. 10 mm (0.39 in), is ensured.
The ball join bearings and the ball bearings must rotate freely without any
jamming or excessive resistance.
Bolted joints, serving for connection of two each other movable parts of the
aircraft flight controls, should be tightened carefully with the wrench or only with
hand. The bolted joint is tightened only to eliminate axial plays of the
connection.
Immediately after tightening of each bolted joint, secure it with the castellated
nut, the cotter pin or the locking pin and check the joint for movability and its
axial play.
After removal and installation of the flight control parts and prior to returning the
aircraft to operation, check always all the flight control parts, which were subject
of your handling, for proper safety.
Orientation of bolts, locking pins and cotter pins:
Mount the bolts into joints according to the rule - from above downwards or
from the front backwards (considering the flight direction). If this principle is
observed, spontaneous dropping out the bolt from the joint is so precluded in

case of unlocking, unscrewing and dropping out the nut during operation. Use
the same principle also when securing the nuts with locking pins or cotter pins.
After installing control elements, always check them for free motion without any
jamming and verify proper safety of all nuts and bolts.
Prior to installing new push-pull rods, adjust their lengths to correspond to their
nominal sizes.
In the whole operating range of the flight controls there must be kept the
specified play between the structure and those movable parts of the control, at
which their motion could be blocked.

###### 3. ADJUSTMENT / TEST

**A.** **Values for deflection adjustment**

**WARNING**

**NON-OBSERVANCE OF CONTROL SURFACES, WING FLAPS OR**
**TRIM** **TABS** **SPECIFIED** **DEFLECTIONS** **CAN** **NEGATIVELY**

**INFLUENCE THE FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AIRCRAFT.**

The control systems have specified deflections that must be always kept in the
course of the aircraft operation. After replacing the control system parts, after
adjusting the cable tension and in other necessary cases, the deflections of
control surfaces and wing flaps must be checked and adjusted as required. The
procedures for adjusting the control surfaces and wing flaps are provided in the
appropriate sections, which describe the individual flight control systems. The
values for checks and adjusting of control surfaces and wing flaps deflections
are given in appropriate chapters.

###### 4. INSPECTION / CHECK

**A.** **Check of plays in flight controls**
At the aircraft operation the flight control and elements become worn-out under
the influence of loading, vibrations etc. This wear is shown by increase of plays.
When the maximum allowable operating play is reached, the worn-out parts
(bearings, bolts, pins, guides etc.) must be replaced.
