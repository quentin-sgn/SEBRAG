### 71-60 AIR INTAKES

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
Cooling air is received through the two upper engine cowling intakes and is
distributed to the engine compartment.
Air intake is located on the left side of spinner. The cold air flows through the ram air
tunnel (glued at the lower engine cowling), air hose, air filter holder and air filter to the
airbox. The air filter holder receives warm air from an shroud installed on the muffler
(Chapter 78) and cold air from the ram air tunnel and mixes them depending on
preheating control setting. CARBUR. PREHEATING controller is located on the
instrument panel.
