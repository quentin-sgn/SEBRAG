### 28-10 STORAGE

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
The aircraft has integral fuel tanks with a total capacity of approximately 126 liters.
The integral fuel tanks are located in the forward box of the wing central section and
both halves of wing. The wing and central section tanks are connected by a simple
hose connection with clamps. There is one large diameter hose between tanks,
which serves the fuel from the wing tanks to central section tanks. There are two
small diameter hoses, one of them is venting line of wing tank and second one is
connects the both tanks (air connection).
The integral fuel tanks are covered by a special paint resistive to fuel with a less
electrical resistance. There is a rib in the each tank for preclusion of a rapid fuel
flowage during the flight manoeuvres.
The fuel tank filler caps are located on a wing upper surface. The drain valves are
located the lowest point of each tank.
