### 78-10 EXHAUST SYSTEM

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
The exhaust gases from each cylinder pass through the exhaust tubes (2, Fig. 78-1)
to the muffler (1) which is attached to the engine mount by holders (3) and clamps
(4). The exhaust tubes are connected to the muffler inlets and are fixed by clamps
(5). The exhaust gases discharge through the exhaust pipe (6) on the left side.
The two-piece heat exchanger (8) and the airbox pre-heat exchanger (7) are
attached to the muffler (1).

1 – Muffler 5 – Clamp

2 – Exhaust tube 6 – Exhaust pipe

3 – Holder 7 – Airbox pre-heat exchanger

4 – Clamp 8 – Heat exchanger

(g) Unscrew all nuts (20) and release the clamps (17).

(h) Remove the clamps (6).

(i) Slightly shift the muffler (1) backward and remove the exhaust tubes
(2; 3).

(j) Unscrew the bolts (18), remove the washers (19) and brackets (7; 8;
9; 10). Carefully remove the muffler (1) with the assembled heat and
airbox pre-heat exchangers (11; 12).

(k) On the muffler (1), remove the lockwire, release and remove the
universal clamps (21) and remove the exchangers (11; 12).

(2) Exhaust system installation:
(a) Make sure that the ignition is OFF.

(b) Make sure that the battery is disconnected and the upper line of
spark plugs is removed from the engine.

(c) Before installation check the exhaust parts for burns and cracks.

###### WARNING

**CHECK THE EXHAUST SYSTEM VERY CAREFULLY. A**
**DEFECTIVE MUFFLER WILL LET THE EXHAUST GASES**
**INTO THE COCKPIT. THIS CAN CAUSE DEATH OR INJURY**
**TO PERSONS OR CAN RESULT IN ENGINE POWER LOSS,**
**POSSIBLY FIRE.**

(d) Install the heat exchanger (12, Fig. 78-02) and the airbox pre-heat
exchanger (12) on the muffler (1) according to Fig. 78-03. Secure
them with the universal clamps (21, Fig. 78-02); secure the universal
clamps (21) with the lockwire (see Chapter 20-20).

(e) Install the muffler (1) between the engine mount struts, slide the short
air hose (14) into the heat exchanger (12) and secure it with the hose
clamp (16).

(f) Install proper brackets (7; 8; 9; 10) (one bracket consists of two
parts) using new washers (19) and the bolts (18); do not tighten
them.

(g) Connect the exhaust tubes (2; 3) with the engine and muffler (1) and
secure them with clamps (17).

(h) Slide on and screw the clamps (6); do not tighten them.

(i) Unscrew the bolts (18), apply Loctite 243 on the bolts (18) threads
and tighten them.

(j) Tighten the clamps (6) and secure them with lockwire (see Chapter
20-20).

(k) Install the exhaust tubes (4; 5), secure them with the clamps (17) and
gradually tighten the nuts (20) on all exhaust tubes (2; 3; 4; 5) –
tightening torque 12 – 20 Nm.
