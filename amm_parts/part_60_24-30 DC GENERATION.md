### 24-30 DC GENERATION

###### 1. DESCRIPTION

**A.** **Generator system**
The generator system consists of the following components:

      - Generator

       - Voltage regulator

      - Charging fuse

       - Low voltage warning light

The maintenance free AC generator is integrated into the engine and supplies
power to the equipment during normal operation.
The generated AC voltage is rectified and regulated by the voltage regulator.
The voltage regulator and charging fuse are installed on the firewall in the
engine compartment.
The low voltage warning light CHARGE is located on the left instrument panel
(Chapter 39-10).

**B.** **Battery**
The lead acid maintenance free battery 12 V / 17 Ah is installed in the engine
compartment at the firewall; supplies power to the starter and is also used as an
emergency power supply when the engine has stopped.

**C.** **SV-BAT-320 backup battery**
SkyView displays have the SV-BAT-320 external backup batteries. In the event
of an electrical failure that causes SkyView to run on the SV-BAT-320,
the SV-BAT-320 supplies power to the SkyView display it is connected to, along
with any connected SV-ADAHRS-200, SV-EMS-220, and SV-GPS-250 module.
A fully charged SV-BAT-320 can keep most SkyView systems operating for at
least 45 minutes.

**NOTE**

Refer to “Dynon Avionics SkyView System Installation, Document 101320022, Revision Q” or later for additional information.
