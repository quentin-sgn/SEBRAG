### 32-40 WHEELS AND BRAKES

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
This chapter describes the wheels and brake system and their operation.
The main landing gear is equipped with an aluminium Beringer wheel discs
(1, Fig. 32-12) with tubeless tires 15x6.00-6 (2). The wheel discs consist of split rim
with two ball bearings. The main wheels are equipped with hydraulic brakes.
The nose landing gear is equipped with an aluminium Beringer wheel disc (3) with
tubeless tire 13x5.00-6 (4). The wheel disc consists of split rim with two ball bearings.
The main gear wheels are equipped with Beringer hydraulic brakes which are
controlled by the brake lever (10) located on the central console. The brake lever
acts through the push rod and lever directly onto the master cylinder (7) located in
the central console. The brake fluid reservoir (9) is also located In the central
console. The assembled pressure limiter (8) is located under the left seat. Master
cylinder is connected with the pressure limiter and both brake callipers (5) by
hydraulic hoses (11).
Brake discs (6) are inserted into to the shaped wheel rim and locked by a wire.
Callipers (5) are attached to the wheel axles.
The brakes have two positions using grooves at the slotted link: parking brake and
maximum braking.
Parking brake operation:
– To apply parking braking, move brake lever backward to PARK position.
– To release parking braking, unlatch the brake lever and release fully forward.
Maximum braking operation:
– To apply the maximum braking, move the brake lever fully backward to MAX
position.
– To release maximum braking, unlatch the brake lever and release fully forward.
Scheme of the brake system is shown in Fig. 32-13.
Only brake fluid of DOT-4 (meets classification J1703c) should be used for the brake
system (type for medium hard or hard operation). In general, the certified automobile
brake fluid meets the requirements. Brake fluid refilling is necessary when the
efficiency of the brake system becomes low due to a fluid leak. The brake system is
fed from the brake fluid reservoir located under the pilot seat.
The brake fluid gets thick during aircraft operation and absorbs air humidity. This is
the most important condition, which causes brake system failures. It is not possible to
determine exactly when it occurs.
Information about the brake fluid used by the manufacturer is recorded on a placard
at the firewall in the engine compartment.

###### 2. MAINTENANCE PRACTICES
All wheels (with tires fitted) must be balanced before the installation. If a new tire is
installed, the wheel must be re-balanced (with the tire fitted) before the installation.
Unbalanced wheels can cause vibration to the landing gear.
