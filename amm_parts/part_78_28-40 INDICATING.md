### 28-40 INDICATING

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
The fuel level sensor is installed in the both left and right fuel tank on the root rib of
fuselage fuel tank. Signal from the fuel level sensor is carried via low value warning
unit and from there to the engine monitoring system unit Dynon SV-EMS 220 and
from there to the Dynon SkyView SV-D1000. Low fuel quantity (less than 16 litres) is
signalized with the LH FUEL RES / RH FUEL RES red warning lamps (Chapter
39-10).
Fuel pressure sensor and standby fuel pressure indicator are installed in the fuel
system and connected through the 3-way distributor with restrictor jets in its outlets to
the 4-way distributor. Both check the actual pressure in the fuel supply line. Signal
from the sensor is carried to the engine monitoring system unit Dynon SV-EMS 220
and from there to the Dynon SkyView SV-D1000.
Exceeding of fuel pressure limit value is signalized by red warning lamp EMS on the
instrument panel (Chapter 39-10).
The fuel flow transducer is located on the engine mount top. The electrically operated
fuel flow transducer transmits fuel flow rate data to the engine monitoring system unit
Dynon EMS 220 and from there to the Dynon SkyView SV-D1000.

(2) Fuel level sensor installation:
(a) Make sure that the ignition switch is set to OFF.

(b) In cockpit on side, put fuel float (1, Fig. 28-9) with seal (2).

(c) Put washers (4), tighten the bolts (3) and secure with Loctite 270.

(d) Connect connectors (5).

(e) Install round cover (3, Fig. 06-3) from inner side of the cockpit to the
left and right side near main wing pin.

(f) Check if sensor is firmly secured and sealed.

(g) Connect negative terminal of the battery (Chapter 24-30).

(h) Remove the ground cable from the aircraft.

(i) Replenish the fuel system (Chapter 12-10).

(j) Carry out engine ground test; check fuel system for leaks and fuel
system indication.

(3) Adjustment / Test – calibration and check of a correct function of the
measurement system and indication of fuel quantity
Carry out this procedure on the aircraft with completely finished fuel
installation.
Perform the procedure in a suitable and exactly defined space. In this
space and in its vicinity don´t carry out, in the course of the calibration, any
other work than the work necessary for performing the calibration.
As working and procedure medium for this calibration, use gasoline
Natural 95 or aviation gasoline Avgas 100LL.
During this procedure, perform the tank filling with fuel by means of the
calibration device or the calibration vessel so that it is possible to
determine a precise quantity of added fuel. For the same reason, use the
calibration device or the calibration vessel also when draining fuel from the
tank. When handling fuel, use the clothing that doesn´t contain artificial
clothes.

###### WARNING

**UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY TO THE SYSTEM SETTINGS AND NON-**
**OBSERVANCE OF THE DEFINED CALIBRATION PROCEDURES**
**MAY CAUSE AN INCORRECT FUNCTIONALITY OR A TOTAL**
**FAILURE OF THE WHOLE SKYVIEW SYSTEM!**

**NOTE**

(j) In "POINT 1" for empty tank "VALUE (LTR) = 0.0" set the value of
"VOLTS" according to the actual value VOLTAGE SENSOR (top
right corner of the screen). Save the set value using the SAVE DONE
buttons.

(k) Add to the tank exactly 5 liters of the fuel. Wave with the fuselage
and wait for spill and stabilization of fuel level in the tank– the aircraft

(m) In "POINT 2" for tank "VALUE (LTR) = 5.0" set the value of "VOLTS"

according to the actual value VOLTAGE SENSOR (top right corner of
the screen). Save the set value using the SAVE DONE buttons.

(n) Repeat procedure in accordance with points (l), (m) and (n) up to 45
