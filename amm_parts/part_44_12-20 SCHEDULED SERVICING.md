###### 3. LUBRICATION CHART
Lubricate movable or rotary places on the aircraft in scheduled intervals (Tab. 12-17).
Regular lubrication decreases frictional forces in movable joints and protects
lubricated places against corrosion. Use recommended lubricants for lubrication (see
below). The lubricants shall not be contaminated with water or foreign matters and
their storage period or usability shall not be expired. After lubrication is finished,
clean the lubricated places from lubricants excess.
The area in which lubrication is done must be dust-free. Thoroughly clean lubricated
points before lubrication.
After cleaning the aircraft with pressure water, lubricate again places which got into
contact with the water stream (hinges of control surfaces and flaps, the nose and
main landing gear etc.).
Use the manufacturer’s recommended greases or equivalent greases that meet the
following properties:

**Vaseline: Lithium grease, suitable for bearing applications in mobile technology**
and industry. Temperature range of use from -30 °C to +120 °C. Consistency
NLGI 3 (NLGI classification). The manufacturer recommends MOL Liton LTA
3EP.
**Lubrication oil: Semi-synthetic oil, resistant to high pressure. Suitable for**
lubrication of points with high pressure loads, e.g. push rods, Bowden cables,
joint connections. Temperature range of use from -35 °C to +180 °C. The
manufacturer recommends the use of HHS 2000.

###### 4. AIRCRAFT CLEANING
Type of maintenance: Line

Personnel qualification: Pilot/Owner qualified in accordance with M.A.803 except
of engine cleaning where minimum authorization
independent certifying staff qualified in accordance with
Part-66 or higher is required.

Recommended tools, materials, persons and documentation:

List of special tools and materials for the cleaning of
the aircraft is shown in Tab. 12-16.

**A.** **Aircraft painted surfaces cleaning**
To maintain the flight characteristics of the aircraft shall be the outer surface of
the aircraft (especially the leading edge of the wings) and the propeller kept
clean.
The outer surface of the aircraft is covered with a durable coat which keeps
good gloss under normal conditions and does not require to be polished often.
At normal operation, e.g. after a flight day, wash the dirty surface of the aircraft
with water and detergent or with non-active soap. After washing the aircraft with
clean water, dry the aircraft.
lt is recommended to renew the painted surface preservation at least twice a
year, e.g. prior to winter operation and after it. A good preservative coating will
protect the aircraft finish from the UV rays and protect the surface against
oxidation. Any good automotive polish or wax may be used.

###### CAUTION

DO NOT USE CLEANING OR POLISHING AGENTS WHICH
CONTAIN SILICONE. IF THE AIRCRAFT NEEDS REPAIR,
SILICONE CAN PREVENT REPAIR MATERIALS FROM BONDING
CORRECTLY.

(1) Procedure:
(a) Close all covers and cabin.

(b) Cover tires. Do not allow tires to stand in pools of cleaning solution
any longer than required for the washing operation.

(c) Cover Pitot-static tube to prevent water and cleaning solution from
entering.

(d) Protect all control surface bearings and other lubricated components
before cleaning the aircraft.

###### CAUTION

 DO NOT DRY-CLEAN THE DUST - QUALITY OF THE AIRCRAFT PAINTED SURFACE IS DE-CREASED BY THIS.

(e) Use large quantities of water to clean the aircraft. If necessary, add a
mild-cleaning agent to the water and remove dust and dirt from
painted surfaces with a sponge

###### CAUTION

WHEN WASHING THE AIRCRAFT WITH WATER AND
CLEANING AGENT, USE SPECIAL CARE TO AVOID
WASHING AWAY GREASE FROM ANY LUBRICATED AREA.
PREMATURE WEAR OF LUBRICATED SURFACES MAY
RESULT IF THESE PRECAUTIONS ARE NOT OBSERVED.

(f) Remove oil and grease using a cloth dampened with benzine.

(g) Remove insects with a sponge and water with mild-cleaning agent.

(h) Carefully rinse the surface to remove all cleaning agent.

(i) Dry the cleaned surface thoroughly with a chamois to prevent
watermarks.

(j) Apply suitable wax or polish on washed and dry surface of the
aircraft, spread it over and polish it with soft flannel cloth.

**NOTE**

When using preservation preparations follow instructions given
on the preparations packaging.

(k) Remove Pitot-static tube cover and protecting of control surface
bearings and other lubricated components.

###### WARNING

**LOOK, IF THE HOLES OF PITOT STATIC TUBE ARE FREE;**
**IN CASE OF DETECTION OBSTACLES IMMEDIATELY**
**REMOVE THEM.**

**B.** **Cabin cleaning**
The cabin may only be cleaned by washing it with a sufficient quantity of water
and an adequate quantity of detergents. Use either a soft, clean cloth sponge or
chamois. Then use suitable polishers to clean the cabin.

(1) Procedure:
(a) To avoid scratching the glass surface, take off watches and rings
before cleaning.

(b) Remove excess amounts of dirt and other foreign matter from the
glass surface with clean water. The preferred method is to spray or
flood the surface to flush away foreign materials. If spraying or
flooding is impractical, thoroughly wet a clean sponge or soft cloth
and carefully wipe the surface.

###### CAUTION

NEVER USE GASOLINE, BENZENE, ALCOHOL, ACETONE,
FIRE EXTINGUISHER, ANTI-ICE FLUID, LACQUER THINNER
OR GLASS CLEANER TO CLEAN THE PLEXIGLASS. THESE
MATERIALS WILL CORRODE THE PLEXIGLASS.

DO NOT RUB THE CANOPY WHILE IT IS DRY. DO NOT USE
DIRTY CLOTHS OR SPONGES. THE PLEXIGLASS CANOPY
SCRATCHES VERY EASILY WITH EVEN THE SMALLEST
PARTICLES OF DUST.

(c) Wash gently using sponge or soft cloth and a solution of water with a
mild liquid soap.

(d) Carefully rinse the surface to remove all cleaning agent.

(e) Dry the cleaned surface thoroughly with a chamois to prevent
watermarks.

(f) Polish glass using a special plexiglass cleaner.

**NOTE**

When using plexiglass cleaner follow instructions given on the
preparations packaging.

**C.** **Interior cleaning**
Aircraft interior should be vacuumed at regular intervals to remove surface dirt
and dust. While vacuuming, use a fine bristle nylon brush to help loosen
particles.

(1) Procedure:
(a) Clean upholstery with a soft bristle brush, and vacuum where
necessary.

(b) Spots on the upholstery clean with detergent. Use suitable upholstery
cleaning agent for spots not cleanable with detergent.

(c) Use clean cloth dampened with a mild detergent to clean interior
panels, covers, handles and buttons.

**D.** **Avionics care**
Avionics displays have an anti-reflective coating that is very sensitive to skin
oils, waxes, ammonia, and abrasive cleaners. Clean the displays screens with
LCD Screen Cleaning Solution according instructions given on the preparations
packaging.

**E.** **Engine cleaning**

###### CAUTION

DO NOT USE EASILY FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS OR CAUSTIC CLEANING
AGENT FOR CLEANING THE ENGINE!

Repair leaks if required before cleaning. Always clean engine in cold state.
Usage of commercially available cold cleaning agent for the engine is
recommended - see Maintenance Manual (Line Maintenance) for Rotax Engine
Type 912 Series (Ref. No. MML-912, Part. No. 899191), Chapter 05-00-00,
Chapter 1.5).
Never clean the engine with cleaner under high pressure. This is damaging to
electrical installations and shaft seals. Oxidation of the various components and
their failure may follow.
Before cleaning, all openings through which cleaning agents and/or dirty water
could enter to the engine have to be closed.
After each cleaning procedure, dry all electrical components such as battery,
ignition unit, spark plug connector, clamp connection etc. with compressed air to
prevent short circuits.

###### CAUTION

WHEN CLEANING THE ENGINE, THE DISSOLVES RESIDUES OF
FUEL, OIL AND OTHER ENVIRONMENT-CONTAMINATING AGENTS
ARE RINSED OFF. COLLECT THE RESIDUAL LIQUIDS AND DISPOSE
THEM IN ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY WAY.

**F.** **Propeller cleaning**
Clean the propeller with water mixed with soap or detergent using a sponge and
finish with the chamois. The metal shields on leading edge may be re-polished
using fine sandpaper, taking care not to alter the surface of the coating.
Lightly coat the metal shields with liquid paraffin to prevent oxidation. Repeat
periodically to keep this protective oily film.
