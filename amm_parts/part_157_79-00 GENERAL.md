### 79-00 GENERAL

###### 1. INTRODUCTION
The engine Rotax 912 ULS2 has a dry sump forced lubrication system. The oil pump
(3, Fig. 79-1) is driven by means of camshaft. The oil accumulates at the bottom of
crankcase and it is forced back to the oil tank (4) by energy of gassed in the
crankcase. The oil pump sucks the engine oil from the oil tank, through the oil
thermostat (9) and oil filter (6) and ensures the engine lubrication. In dependence of
temperature, the oil thermostat opens the circuit of oil cooler (5). The oil tank is
equipped with a venting hose (7).

**NOTE**

Refer to the Maintenance Manual for Engine Type 912 Series, Ref. No.:
MML-912 for additional information.
