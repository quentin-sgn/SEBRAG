### 05-20 SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE CHECKS

###### CAUTION

THE RECOMMENDED PERIODS DO NOT CONSTITUTE A

GUARANTEE THE ITEM WILL REACH THE PERIOD WITHOUT
MALFUNCTION.

###### 1. RESPONSIBILITY OF OWNER
The owner is responsible for maintaining the aircraft in an airworthy condition, including compliance with all applicable Airworthiness Directives.
The owner must ensure that qualified personnel do the maintenance.
The owner should ensure that the airframe, aircraft systems and power plant mechanic inspecting the aircraft has access to all necessary manuals and service information.
The owner is responsible to obtain specific approval from their local Airworthiness
Authority for any alternation to the inspect program.
The owner is responsible to ensure that all service bulletins which are pertinent to his
particular operation are complied with.

###### 2. AUTHORISATION TO PERFORM
In the particular chapters of Aircraft Maintenance Manual are established the levels
of certification needed to accomplish the task.

**A.** **Heavy maintenance**
Heavy maintenance is authorised to be performed by:

      - Independent certifying staff qualified in accordance with Part-66

     - Maintenance personnel of a Part-M, Section A Subpart F maintenance or
ganisation

**B.** **Line maintenance**
Line maintenance is authorised to be performed by:

      - Independent certifying staff qualified in accordance with Part-66

     - Maintenance personnel of a Part-M, Section A Subpart F maintenance or
ganisation

     - Some line maintenance is authorised to be performed by a Pilot/Owner qual
ified in accordance with M.A.803.

Minimum required authorisation for performing of 25 hr. / 100 hr. / annual / special
inspection is independent certifying staff qualified in accordance with Part-66 or higher.

###### 3. INSPECTION GUIDELINES
The List of Inspection Requirements is given in Tab. 05-4.
Detailed inspection procedures of systems and components in the aircraft will be
found in various chapters of this Aircraft Maintenance Manual.

###### 4. INSPECTION OF ITEMS – GENERAL
ln the text of individual operations, where the check for condition is required, dominant activities carried out at checking for condition can be mentioned in brackets, e.g.
"check fuselage skin for condition (damage, deformation, cracks)".

**A.** **Movable parts:**

lnspect for lubrication, servicing, security of attachments, binding, excessive wear,
safetying, proper operation, proper adjustment, correct travel, cracked fittings, security of hinges, defective bearings, cleanliness, corrosion, deformation, sealing and tension.

**B.** **Fluid lines and hoses:**

lnspect for leaks, cracks, collapsing, twisting, dents, kinks, chaffing, proper bend radius, security, discoloration, deterioration, proper routing, rubber hoses for hardness
or flexibility loss and metal lines for corrosion, check service life of hoses.

**C.** **Metal parts:**

lnspect for attachments, fatigue cracks, broken spot-welds, distortion, deterioration,
condition of paints (especially clamps and hose ties at seams and around fasteners
for onset of corrosion) and any other apparent damage.

**D.** **Composite parts:**

lnspect for cracks, separation of bond, delamination, wear, overheating, fluid saturation, deformation, condition of paint and any other apparent damage.

**E.** **Structural fasteners:**

lnspect for wear, damage, stretch, proper torque (when inspection indicates the need
for a torque check), and safety wiring.

**F.** **Filters, screens and fluids:**

lnspect for cleanliness and replace at specified intervals.

**G.** **Wiring:**

lnspect for security, chafing, defective insulation, loose and broken terminals, heat
deterioration, terminals corrosion and any other apparent damage.
