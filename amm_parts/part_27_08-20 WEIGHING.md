### 08-20 WEIGHING

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
The aircraft must be operated within the permitted limits of load and center of gravity to
obtain the expected flight performance, flight characteristics and flight safety.
After more complex modification, more extended repair, repainting, etc., of the
aircraft, etc., the weight and center of gravity may be influenced, the new basic empty
weight / moment and CG position must be determined by weighing.
When a compact piece of equipment is installed on (or removed from) the aircraft and
an accurate weight and center of gravity arm (distance from the aircraft’s reference
datum to the installed equipment’s center of gravity) can be accurately specified, the
new basic empty weight / moment and CG position can be calculated using the
aircraft’s weight and balance record.
Reference datum is an imaginary vertical plane from which all horizontal distances for
the center of gravity calculations are measured. The reference datum is located
1.975 mm forward direction from inner surface of the firewall, perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis of the aircraft.
Permitted limits of empty aircraft weight and CG are given in the POH (Chapter 6).

(1) Preparation for weighing:
(a) Defuel the aircraft’s fuel system (Chapter 12-10).

(b) Weigh the aircraft in a closed building to prevent errors due to wind
gusts.

(c) Remove all snow, ice, dirt and water from the aircraft’s surfaces.

(d) Remove all snow, ice and dirt from the wheel fairings.

(e) Remove all objects not included in the aircraft’s Equipment List.

(f) Remove all objects not included in the aircraft’s Weight and Balance
Record.

(g) Verify all items in the Equipment List are installed in their correct
location.

(h) Inflate the aircraft’s tires to their recommended operating pressures
(Chapter 12-10).

(i) Verify oil, brake fluid and coolant are at their prescribed maximum
levels (Chapter 12-10).

(j) Close covers and other lids.

(k) Place scales under each wheel (minimum scale capacity 300 kg /
660 lb).

(l) Brake lever to PARK position.

(m) Remove the external control locks and place all controls to their

neutral position. Retract the wing flaps

(2) Aircraft leveling:
(a) Level the aircraft on wheels (Chapter 08-10).

(3) Weighing:
(a) With the aircraft leveled and canopy closed, obtain and record the
aircraft data into a photocopy of the Aircraft Weighing Form.

(b) Obtain and record the value “X” by measuring horizontally and
parallel to the aircraft center line, from a line stretched between main
wheel centers to a plumb line dropped from the Reference Point
(RP).

(c) Obtain and record the value “Y” by measuring horizontally and
parallel to the aircraft center line, from a line stretched between main
wheel centers to a plumb line dropped from the center of nose wheel
axle.

(d) Obtain and record the weights shown on each scale, deduct the tare
(if any) and calculate the net weights.

(e) Determine and record the arms “A” and “B”.

(f) Determine and record the moment for each weighting point using
following formula:

𝑀𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡= 𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑥 𝐴𝑟𝑚

(g) Calculate and record the Empty Weight / Moment by totaling the
appropriate columns. Calculate and record the Empty Weight CG
using formula given in the form.

(h) Calculate the correction for unusable fuel and record the Basic
Empty Weight / Moment. Calculate and record the Basic Empty
Weight CG using formula given in the form.

(i) Compare the calculated values with the permitted limits given in the
POH (Chapter 6).

(j) Record the new Basic Empty Weight / Moment into the Weight and
Balance Record of POH (Chapter 6).

###### CAUTION

WHEN PERMITTED TOLERANCE OF AIRCRAFT EMPTY WEIGHT AND
CG POSITION IS EXCEEDED, CONTACT THE AIRCRAFT

MANUFACTURER.

(4) After weighing:
(a) Ensure all air is removed from the fuel system.

(b) Inflate the nose and main landing gear tires to their prescribed
operating pressures (Chapter 12-10).
