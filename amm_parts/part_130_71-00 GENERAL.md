###### 1. INTRODUCTION
This chapter describes:

     - The power plant installed in the aircraft.

     - The components that make the power plant.

     - Maintenance practices concerning the power plant.

The maintenance of engine Rotax 912 ULS2 itself must be performed according to
engine manufacturer’s documentation:

     - Maintenance Manual (Line Maintenance) for Rotax Engine Type 912
Series, Ref. No.: MML-912

     - Maintenance Manual (Heavy Maintenance) for Rotax Engine Types 912
and 914 Series (Ref. No. MMH-912 / MMH-914

**NOTE**

Refer to the Pilot´s Operating Handbook WT9 Dynamic LSA / Club for engine
start/stop procedures.

The power plant has a top and a bottom engine cowling. The two halves are
connected to the airframe with camlock fasteners.

     - Cowling (Chapter 71-10)

The engine is fixed to the airframe through an engine mount. Engine mount is
attached to the engine with four bolts and to the firewall through four rubber
silentblocks.

     - Engine attachment (Chapter 71-20)

Holders installed on the engine are used for hoses and wires attachment.

     - Attach fittings (Chapter 71-40)

The engine air induction system receives ram air through an intake tunnel glued on
the left side of lower engine cowling. The air flows through the air hoses, air filter
holder with pre-heating, air filter to airbox. Airbox is connected to two carburettors.

     - Air intakes (Chapter 71-60)

The airbox, drip trays under carburettors and mechanical fuel pump are drained.

     - Engine drains (Chapter 71-70)
