### 21-20 DISTRIBUTION

###### 1. DESCRIPTION

**A.** **Cockpit ventilation**
Venting air comes from the ram air tunnel (1, Fig. 21-1) installed on the left side
of lower engine cowling and directs through the air hose (2) to the control box
(3). Amount of venting air entering the cockpit is controlled by the CABIN
**VENTILATION controller (4).**

Additional venting air supply the eyeball vents (5). The eyeball vents receive the
venting air from the NACA intakes (6) located on the both sides of canopy.
Venting air from NACA intakes is also distributed through the canopy frame to
the small holes blowing the windshield. This air is regulated by VENTILATION
knobs (7) located on the both sides of canopy in front of eyeball vents. For
ventilation also may be used sliding windows on the canopy.
