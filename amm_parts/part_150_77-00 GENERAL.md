### 77-00 GENERAL

###### 1. INTRODUCTION
This chapter describes those components that indicate engine operation.
Engine instruments function fulfils the SV-D1000 EMS multifunction display of the
Dynon SkyView system.
The sensors that sense the engine parameters, transmits the information to the SVEMS-220 module. Information after processing is sent to the SV-D1000 EMS
The SV-EMS-220 Module provides the interface between the SV-D1000 EMS and
the engine sensors. It allows the SkyView System to continuously monitor all power
plant systems in a highly automated manner. Any parameter falling outside its
predefined limits are automatically brought to the attention of the pilot for immediate
remediation.
Following engine parameters are displayed on the screen of SV-D1000 EMS (see
Fig. 77-1):

   - Engine RPM

   - Coolant temperature

   - EGT temperature

   - Airbox temperature

   - Oil temperature (Chapter 79-30)

   - Oil pressure (Chapter 79-30)

   - Manifold pressure

   - Current

   - Voltage

Exceeding of engine parameters is signalized with the EMS warning lamp
(Chapter 31-50).
In case of SV-EMS-220 Module failure, the engine rpm are displayed on the standby
RPM indicator.
