### 27-10 AILERON AND ROLL TRIM

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
Ailerons are controlled through the control sticks, attached to the control stick's
torsion tube (7, Fig. 27-1). Movement from control sticks is transferred to the ailerons
through the push-pull rod 1 (1), push-pull rod 2 (2), bellcrank (3) and push-pull
rod 3 (4).
Push-pull rods 1 are equipped with adjustable bearing eye at one and revolving fork
at the other. Push-pull rods 2 are equipped with adjustable bearing eyes on both
ends and are guided in two guide bearings (6) in the wing (in the root rib and support
rib). Bellcranks are fitted with bearings and fixed in the consoles that are attached to
the main wing spar. Bellcranks provide necessary differentiation of the ailerons
deflections. The deflections of the ailerons are differentiated 1:1.6.
Push-pull rods 3 are equipped with adjustable bearing eyes on both ends and are
connected to the lever (6) on the aileron root ribs.
Range of aileron control movement is limited by stops (8) on the control stick’s
torsion tube (7).
Roll trim tab is located only on the right aileron. The tab is operated through actuator
installed in the aileron and controlled with rocker switch installed on the pedestal
panel. Actuator and tab are interconnected with push-pull rod.
Trim tab position is displayed on the EFIS.
The only left handle is equipped with a control stick shaker that is part of stall warning
system (Chapter 31-50).
Wiring diagram of aileron trim is described in the Aircraft Wiring Manual (Doc. No.
AS-AWM-01-000).
