###### 1. INTRODUCTION
This chapter describes those units and components which deliver metered fuel to the
engine. Components covered the standby fuel pressure indicator, fuel pressure
sensor and fuel flow transducer that part of aircraft manufacturer installation.
Fuel is supplied to the engine in dependence from FUEL selector valve position
(LEFT - RIGHT - OFF). From both fuel tanks the fuel flows through the fuel filters to
the FUEL selector valve inlets. From the FUEL selector valve the fuel flows through
the electric fuel pump (by-passed with check valve) to engine driven fuel pump and
then to distributor inlet.
One of distributor's outlets is connected to carburettors through the fuel flow meter
sensor and 3-way distributor. Second one is fitted with restrictor jet to which return
line is connected. Return line leads back to the left fuel tank.
Fuel flow transducer is installed the way to measure only the fuel consumed by
engine.
Fuel pressure sensor and standby fuel pressure indicator are installed in the fuel
system and connected through the 3-way distributor with restrictor jets in its outlets to
the 4-way distributor. Both check the actual pressure in the fuel supply line.
Scheme of fuel system is stated in Chapter 28.
Wiring diagram of fuel pressure sensor and fuel flow transducer is described in the
Aircraft Wiring Manual (Doc. No. AS-AWM-01-000).
