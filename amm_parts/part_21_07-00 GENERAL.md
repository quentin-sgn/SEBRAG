The aircraft is jacked and shored for maintenance, replacement of components,
overhaul, and repair etc.
When possible, the aircraft should be located on a level surface. The jacking site
should be protected from wind (preferably inside a hangar).
The aircraft may be jacked with the full fuel tanks.
When possible, the jacks should be used together with shoring.
