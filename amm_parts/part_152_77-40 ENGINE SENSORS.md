### 77-40 ENGINE SENSORS

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
This section describes that portion of the engine indicating system which indicates
engine parameters:

   - Coolant temperature

   - EGT

   - Airbox temperature

   - Oil. temperature

   - Oil pressures

   - Manifold pressure

   - Current

Signal from the sensors is carried to the engine monitoring system unit Dynon EMS
220 and from there to the Dynon SkyView SV-D1000.
All the engine parameters are displayed on the SV-D1000 EMS.
Wiring diagram of engine sensors is described in the Aircraft Wiring Manual (Doc.
No. AS-AWM-01-000).

###### 2. MAINTENANCE PRACTICES

**A.** **Coolant temperature sensor**
