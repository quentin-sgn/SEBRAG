### 27-30 ELEVATOR AND PITCH TRIM

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
Both control sticks (1, Fig. 27-10) are fitted with bearings, attached to the control
stick's torsion tube (2) and linked inside of torsion tube with connecting push-pull rod
(3). Torsion tube turns in sliding bearings (4) which are attached to the central
section main spar.
Elevator is controlled through 3 push-pull rods that are equipped with adjustable
bearing eyes. Push-pull rods are located in the central tunnel. Movement from control
sticks is transferred to the elevator through the push-pull rod 1 (5), two-armed lever
(6), push-pull rod 2 (7), support lever (8) and push-pull rod 3 (9) to the elevator lever
(10). Elevator lever is fixed to the both halves of elevator and hinged through the
bearing to the elevator root hinge (11). Elevator root hinge is attached to the
horizontal stabilizer aft web.
Range of elevator control movement is limited by the front stop (13) installed on the
central section main spar and the aft stop (12) (tube with a bolt installed inside of the
central tunnel).
There is a bob weight (14) installed at lever (15) and connected to the control stick's
torsion tube by push-pull rod (16).
Pitch trim system is connected to the push-pull rod 1 (5). Pitch trim consists of two
tension springs (18; 19). The springs are attached to the push-pull rod 1 (5) by
means of sleeves (19) and support lever (20). Support lever is operated through
actuator (21 and controlled by a rocker switch installed on the pedestal panel.
Position of the elevator trim is displayed on the EFIS.
Wiring diagram of elevator trim is described in the Aircraft Wiring Manual (Doc. No.
AS-AWM-01-000).
