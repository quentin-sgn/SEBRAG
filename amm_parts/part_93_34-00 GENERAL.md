### 34-00 GENERAL

###### 1. INTRODUCTION

This chapter describes the navigation systems, units, and components which provide
aircraft navigational information. Included are pitot-static, compass, navigation
systems, and indicators. The subjects to be covered in this chapter are as follows:
The Flight Environmental Data/Pitot Static section describes systems which sense
environmental conditions and use the data to influence navigation of the aircraft. This
includes components that depend on the pitot-static system such as airspeed
indicator, altimeter, vertical speed indicator and ADAHRS module of the Dynon
SkyView system.
The Attitude and Direction section describes systems which use magnetic,
gyroscopic and inertia forces. This includes Dynon SkyView system and the
magnetic compass.
The Independent Position Determining section describes systems which provide
information to determine position from sources which are mainly independent of
ground installations. This includes the global positioning system and traffic sensor.
The Dependent Position Determining section describes systems which provide
information to determine position from sources which are mainly dependent on
ground installations. This includes systems such as radio navigational aids and
transponder.
Wiring diagram of above mentioned equipment is described in the Aircraft Wiring
Manual (Doc. No. AS-AWM-01-000).
