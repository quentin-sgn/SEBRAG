### 10-20 MOORING

###### 1. GENERAL
The aircraft is moored when parked outside (on apron). A correct mooring is highly
important if strong wind is expected, or during long-time parking. When a strong wind
affects the aircraft (e.g. storm), the aircraft structure could be damaged. When strong
wind is expected, park the aircraft inside a hangar. If this is not possible, the aircraft
has to be moored.

###### 2. MAINTENANCE PRACTICES

**A.** **Mooring**
The following tie-down points are provided on the aircraft:

     - On the wings – install tie-down screws into hole located in the left and right
lower wing surface (near inspection hole).

     - On the nose landing gear

Type of maintenance: Line

Personnel qualification: Pilot/Owner qualified in accordance with M.A.803
or higher.

###### CAUTION

NEVER ATTACH MOORING ROPES DIRECTLY TO THE AIRCRAFT
