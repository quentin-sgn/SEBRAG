### 27-20 RUDDER

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
The rudder is controlled by foot control pedals. The position of pedals for pilot and
co-pilot is remotely adjustable. The rudder is controlled through steel cables. Nose
gear steering is controlled through push-pull rods. The range of rudder deflections is
limited by stops glued to the fin root.
The rudder pedal’s torsion tubes (1, Fig. 27-5) are attached to the floor in four
holders (2). The motion of pedals (3) is transferred through torsion tubes arms and
control cables (4) to the rudder root rib (5). The polyurethane casings are attached to
the fuselage structure to guide the control cables. There are turnbuckles (6) for
adjusting tension in control cables.
The rudder control pedals are connected to the nose landing gear leg (7) through two
push-pull rods (8).
Pedal positions can be adjusted with control handles (9) that release locking pins.
Three possible positions are available. Pedals are fitted with springs to return to the
rearward position during adjusting.
