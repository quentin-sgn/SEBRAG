### 74-10 ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLY

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
The engine Rotax 912 ULS2 engine is equipped with a dual ignition unit of a
breakerless, capacitor discharge design, with an integrated generator
(Chapter 24-10).
The ignition unit needs no external power supply.
Two independent charging coils (1) located on the generator stator supply one
ignition circuit each. The energy is stored in capacitors of the electronic modules
(2, Fig. 74-1). At the moment of ignition 2 each of the 4 external trigger coils (3)
actuate the discharge of the capacitors via the primary circuit of the ignition coils (4).
The trigger coil (5) is provided for rpm indicator signal (Chapter 39-10).

1 – Charging coils 4 – Dual ignition coils

2 – Electronic modules 5 – Trigger coils for speed signal

3 – Trigger coils for ignition signal
