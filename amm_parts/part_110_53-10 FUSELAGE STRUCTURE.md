### 53-10 FUSELAGE STRUCTURE

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
Fuselage is monocoque glass/carbon composite construction consisting of three
parts that are bonded together: left side (1, Fig. 53-1), right side (2) and lower section
(3). There is shaped fuselage end and a rear lower fin bonded to the fuselage to
enlarge the area of stabilizing surface.
The fuselage sandwich shell is stiffened with firewall, bulkheads, ribs, stiffeners and
interior components creating cockpit. Major items of structure are main (4) and
auxiliary spar (5) to which the wings are attached. Main and auxiliary spar are
bonded in the central section of fuselage. The caps of these spars are made of
carbon rovings and the web is made of glass fabrics, foam panels with plywood
inserts.
There is a steel rope for emergency parachute system incorporated in the right side
of fuselage.
The plywood firewall (6) to which the engine is attached is stiffened with a carbon
stiffener, interior floor and rescue system board. Firewall has stiffened areas for
engine mount and nose landing gear leg attaching. From the engine compartment is
covered with a stainless steel shield.
In the cockpit there are two not adjustable seats which are arranged side by side.
The crew space is limited by firewall in the front and backrest (8) in the rear. In the
middle of cockpit there is a central tunnel which divides cockpit for left and right side
and passes through the baggage compartment which is also divided in two sections.
Baggage compartment is limited by backrest in the front and by baggage bulkhead
(9) in the rear. Baggage bulkhead is sloped in the upper section and fitted with
covered opening allowing access to the rear section of fuselage. Rear section of
fuselage is stiffened with the elliptical bulkheads. On the both sides of the fuselage
there are windows in the baggage compartment.
Vertical stabilizer (11) sandwich shell construction and is integral part of fuselage.
Rudder hinges are attached to the rear web of vertical stabilizer. The horizontal
stabilizer is fixed bonded to the fuselage and is sandwich shell construction with a
rear web (Chapter 55-10).
Integral fuel tanks are located in the forward box of wing central section (3) on the left
and right sides.
In the wing central section are bonded ribs to which the main landing gear legs are
attached.

###### 2. MAINTENANCE PRACTICES
Fuselage is made from composite materials, no servicing is required. Repairs of the
fuselage are described in Chapter 51.
