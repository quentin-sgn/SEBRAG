### 20-20 SAFETYING

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
The use of safety wire, cotter pins, lock washers, self-locking nuts, and Loctite is to
prevent relative movement of critical components subject to vibration, torque, tension,
etc., which could cause attaching parts to be broken, loosened and or detached.
All attachment points for rotating surfaces should be attached with castellated nuts,
cotter pins or lock wire and drilled bolt shanks. The use of self-locking nuts is not
permitted on rotating joints.
If the locking effect of a component is limited, always replace it with a new
component.
Every non-locked nut or bolt (without cotter pin, self-locking nut, serrated locking
washerâ€¦), must be locked using some kind of Loctite.
During assembling, always use the following new parts:

   - Cotter pin

   - Roll pin

   - Tab washer

   - Serrated locking washer

   - Rivets

   - Safety clamps

   - Cable ties

   - Sealing adhesive tape

   - Gasket ring

   - Lock wire

   - Pyrosil tape

   - Shrink cable

   - Sealing ring

###### 2. MAINTENANCE PRACTICES

**A.** **Lockwire**
Lock wire comes in two types, which are identified by size:

     - Zinc plated and Tin-plated steel wire. Used for general lock wiring
procedures.

     - Corrosion resistant steel wire. This wire is to be used in areas with high
temperature and chemical corrosion.

For general-purpose lock wiring, 0.5 mm diameter wire is used on treads from
M4 to M10, and 0.8 mm diameter wire is used on threads M12 and up.

(1) Method:
The double-twist method of lock wiring should be used as the common
method of lock wiring (Fig. 20-3; 20-4). The single wire method of lock
wiring may be used in closely spaced, closed geometrical pattern (triangle,
square, circle, etc.), on parts in electrical systems, and in places that
would make the single wire method more advisable. Closely spaced
should be considered a maximum of 50 mm between centers.

###### CAUTION

SCREWS IN CLOSELY SPACED GEOMETRLC PATTERNS
WHICH SECURE HYDRAULLC OR AIR SEALS, HOLD

HYDRAULLC PRESSURE, OR WHERE USED IN CRITICAL
AREAS, SHOULD USE THE DOUBLE-TWIST METHOD OF LOCK
WIRING.

(2) Spacing:
(a) When lock wiring is widely spaced in multiple groups using the
double-twist method, three units should be the maximum number in
series.

(b) When lock wiring is closely spaced in multiple groups, the number of
units that can be lock wired by 600 mm length of wire should be the
maximum number in series.

(c) Widely spaced multiple groups should mean those in which the
fastenings are from 100 to 150 mm apart. Lock wiring should not be
used to secure fasteners or fittings which are spaced more than
150 mm apart, unless tie points are provided on adjacent parts to
shorten the span of the lock wire to less than 150 mm.

(3) Tension:
(a) Parts should be lock wired in such a manner that the lock wire should
be put in tension when the parts tend to loosen. The lock wire should
always be installed and twisted so the loop around the head stays
down and does not tend to come up over the bolt head and leave a
stacked loop.

**NOTE**

This does not necessarily apply to the castellated nuts when the
slot is close to the top of the nut, the wire will be more secure if
it is made to pass along the side of the stud.

(b) Care should be exercised when installing lock wire to ensure it is
tight but not overstressed.

(4) Use of a lock wire:
(a) When removing lock wire ensure that all pieces are removed.

(b) Use only new lock wire of the same type and diameter as that which
was removed. Never reuse lock wire.

(c) A pigtail 12 mm or six twist should be made at end of the wiring. This
pigtail should be bent back or under to prevent it from becoming a
snag.

(d) When castellated nuts are to be secured with lock wire, tighten the
nut to the low side of the selected torque range otherwise specified,
and, if necessary, continue tightening until a slot aligns with the hole.
ln no case should you exceed the high side torque range.

(e) Drain plugs and cocks may be safetied to a bolt, nut or other part
having a free lock hole in accordance with the instruction described
in this chapter.

(f) When locking is required on electrical connectors (Fig. 20-5) which
use threaded couplings, or on plugs which employ screws or rings to
fasten the individual parts of the plug together, they should be lock
wired with 0,5 mm diameter wire in accordance with the locking
principles as describes and illustrated. lt is preferable to lock wire all
electrical connectors individually. Do not lock wire one connector to
another unless it is necessary to do so.

(g) Lock wire shall not be used on emergency devices that would
depend on fracture of lock wire for operation. However, where
existing structural equipment or safety-of-flight emergency devices
require shear wire to secure equipment while not in use, but which
are dependent upon shearing or breaking the lock wire for successful
emergency operation of equipment, particular care should be
exercised to assure that wiring under these circumstances will not
prevent emergency operations of these devices.

**B.** **Cotter pins**

(1) Use of cotter pins:
(a) Select cotter pins in accordance with atmosphere and service
limitations.

(b) Use only a new cotter pin of the same type as the one removed.
Never reuse cotter pins.

(c) When nuts are to be secured to the fastener with cotter pins, tighten
the nut to the low side of applicable specified or selected torque
range, unless otherwise specified, and if necessary, continue
tightening until the slot aligns with the hole. ln no case should you
exceed the high side torque range.

(d) Castellated nuts mounted on bolts may be safetied with cotter pins or
lock wire. The preferred method is with a cotter pin, bent parallel to
the axis of the bolt (Fig. 20-6). The alternate method, where the
cotter pin is mounted normal to the axis of the bolt, may be used
when the cotter pin in the preferred method may become a snag.

(e) ln the event than the cotter pin diameter is above the nut castellation,
a washer should be used under the nut or a shorter fastener should
be used. A maximum of two washers is per- mitted under the nut.

(f) Use the largest nominal diameter cotter pin that the hole and slots
will accommodate. No application of cotter pin to any nut or fastener
is permitted if the fastener hole size is less than the required hole
and slot size for the cotter pin.

(g) lnstall the cotter pin with the head firmly in the slot of the nut with the
axis of eye at right angles to the bolt shank. Bend prongs so the head
and upper prong are firmly seated against the bolt.

(h) ln pin applications, install the cotter pin with the axis of eye parallel to
the shank of pin. Bend prongs around the shank of the pin.

(i) lnstall the cotter pins (if it is possible):

          - from above-downwards

           - from the front-backwards.

(j) Cadmium plated cotter pins should not be used in applications
bringing them in contact with fuel, hydraulic fluid or synthetic
lubricant.

(k) If using a castellated nut and new bolt, screw the castellated nut to
operating position and use diameter 1,6 mm drill to drill a hole for the
cotter pin.

**C.** **Self-locking nuts**
Self-locking nuts may be used in some applications. The following guidelines
must be followed when using self-locking nuts:

(1) Use of self-locking nuts:
(a) Self-locking nuts must be installed so at least two threads of bolt,
stud or screw are visible.

(b) Self-locking nuts, which are attached to the structure, will be attached
in a positive manner to eliminate the possibility of their rotation or
misalignment when tightening the bolt and screw.

(c) Self-locking nuts are for one-time use only and must not be reused.

(d) Use only a new self-locking nut of the same type as the one
removed.

**D.** **Lock washers**
Lock washers may be used provided the following conditions are met:

(1) Use of lock washers:
(a) When self-locking feature cannot be provided in externally or
internally threaded parts.

(b) When a cotter pin cannot be used to prevent rotation of internal
threads with respect to external threads.

(c) When lock wire cannot be used to prevent loosening of threaded
parts.

(d) When loosening of threaded parts will not endanger the safety of the
aircraft or occupants.

(e) When corrosion is encouraged by the gouging of aluminum by edges
of teeth on tooth locked washers, this will cause malfunction of parts
being fastened together.

(2) The following guidelines must be followed when using lock washers:
(a) Use only new washer for each assembly.

(b) When bending or setting the washer tabs, do not use sharp pointed
tools. Use of such tools can lead to subsequent failure of the locking
tabs that, upon becoming detached, can cause extensive damage.

**E.** **Loctite**

**NOTE**

Loctite type and suitable cleaner is listed in the relevant chapter in the
Materials table.

(1) Use of Loctite:
(a) Loctite is used on the aircraft when it is impossible to cotter pins/lock
wire a fastener or if cotter pins/lock wire is impractical.

(b) Use only Loctite of the same type as that which was originally used.

(c) Application of Loctite should be accomplished at temperature above
15Â°C to ensure proper curing.

(2) Prepare surface:
(a) Clean all parts to which Loctite is to be applied.

(b) Surfaces must be clean and free of dust, oil, grease, condensation,
moisture, and other contaminations.

(3) Apply Loctite to threaded fasteners:
(a) Select correct type of Loctite.

(b) Clean threaded surfaces with suitable degreaser.

(c) Apply Loctite to threads by brushing, dipping, or running applicator
over threads.

**NOTE**

Loctite may be applied to either the nut or bolt; however, for
blind hole applications, coat the sides of the blind hole and first
two threads of the male fastener.

(d) Assemble parts and torque using normal torque (Chapter 20-10).

(e) Excessive Loctite may be removed using a cotton cloth dampened
with cleaner.
