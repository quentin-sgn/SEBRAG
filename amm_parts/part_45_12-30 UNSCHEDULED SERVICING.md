Contamination of aircraft surface by ice or snow degrades the
aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft and increases its weight. It
is therefore important to get rid of any deposit of ice or snow before
flight. If possible, put the aircraft in a heated hangar to remove ice.

###### WARNING

**ICE OR SNOW MUST BE COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM THE**
**UPPER AND LOWER SURFACES OF THE AIRCRAFT.**

###### CAUTION

DO NOT USE SHARP OBJECTS TO REMOVE SNOW OR ICE.
YOU CAN DAMAGE THE AIRCRAFT STRUCTURE.

(a) Use a soft brush and remove snow from the aircraft.

(b) Spray an approved de-icing fluid on ice covered surfaces with a
suitable spray bottle.

(c) Use a soft cloth to dry the aircraft after the snow and ice has been
removed.
