###### 1. INTRODUCTION
You can move the aircraft on the ground with:

   - pushing / pulling

   - the tow bar

   - taxiing

When towing or handling the aircraft close to obstacles (buildings, other aircraft) a
wing walker should follow the aircraft and inform about a danger of the aircraft
collision with the obstacles.
