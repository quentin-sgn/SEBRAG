### 39-10 INSTRUMENT AND CONTROL PANELS

###### 1. DESCRIPTION
Instrument panel is made of glass/carbon fabric laminate and is attached to the
central tunnel and both sides of fuselage. In the middle of top edge is the panel
supported with composite bar. The instrument panel is covered with glass laminate
cover. The cover overlaps the instrument panel to limits undesirable reflections on
instruments displays. The panel is divided into three sections: left, centre and right.
Under the instrument panels, on both left and right side, are located remote controls
for position adjustment of rudder pedals.

  - EMS exceeding of the engine limit parameters

   - OIL PRESS. oil pressure is less than 2 bar / 29 psi

  - CHARGE voltage is less than approximately 12.5 volts.

Control and warning lamps function can be verified by pressing of the TEST button.
In the left lower corner is located 12 V / 10 A power socket.

**Central section of instrument panel:**
In bottom section are installed: IGNITION switches, starter key and MASTER
**SWITCH. There are also installed transponder Garmin GTX328, radio Garmin GNC**
255A, intercom PM3000, standby variometer 5StVM 10 and standby RPM indicator
ROAD IF61.2B35.2301.
Sticker with registration marks is also placed in this section.
At the top of centre section there is installed magnetic compass Airpath C-2400P on
the glare shield.

**Right section of instrument panel:**

###### CAUTION

DURING THE ACTUALIZATION PROCEDURE, CONSTANT

ELECTRICAL SUPPLY HAS TO BE MAINTAINED AND SECURED
AND THE CONNECTED USB FLASH DRIVES CANNOT BE
UNPLUGGED NOR MANIPULATED.

Dynon Avionics provides a free-of-charge upgrade of a firmware for all
Dynon’s products and is continuously adding new functions to these
products and enhances its properties. These activities are monitored by
aircraft manufacturer which also evaluates whether the last Dynon
firmware versions is compatible with aircraft manufacturer SkyView
settings and through the Mandatory Service Bulletin issuance (newest
firmware version publication) aircraft manufacturer will inform aircraft
operators regarding the related system changes and actualization
procedures to update SkyView system.
SkyView SV-D1000 display firmware upgrade automatically updates all
related modules connected to the internal network with the SkyView
displays. That’s why all devices connected within the system have to be
turned on during the actualization procedure. The firmware actualization
has to be performed separately on each SV-D1000 display. The
actualization procedure requires to copy all upgrade related files to the
SkyView display from a given USB flash drives (separately for each
display due to different setting of each display) which have to be plugged
into the related USB ports (LH D1000, RH D1000).
Map Databases updates are not controlled by aircraft manufacturer
Mandatory Service Bulletin. Publication of the Map Databases new
versions is to be monitored entirely by an aircraft owner / operator. A freeof-charge Terrain Databases updates provided by Dynon Avionics (REG04-EUROPE HIRES, WORLD WIDE TERRAIN-LOW RES, WORLD WIDE
TERRAIN-VERY LOW RES) are needed to be performed separately on
each SkyView screen. A free-of-charge default Map Database updates
provided by Dynon Avionics (BASE MAP – EUROPE) and a paid updates
of the Aviation and Obstacle Databases provided by PocketFMS and
Jeppesen (AVDATA and OBDATA) are performed on one screen only.

A recommended 4GB USB flash drive intended for the files transfer during
the actualization procedure is supplied with every SkyView display SVD1000. To start a firmware actualization a 50 MB free disk space is
needed.
Procedure to perform SkyView system upgrade is mentioned in the aircraft

(1) Magnetic compass removal:
(a) Remove screws and carefully lift the instrument panel cover
(Chapter 39-10, 2.A.).

(b) Remove the mounting nuts (3, Fig. 39-18), washers (4) and screws
(2).

(c) Remove compass (1).

(2) Magnetic compass installation:
(a) Place the compass (1, Fig. 39-18) on the instrument panel cover (5);
hold the compass and attach it with screws (2), washers (4) and nuts
(3).

(b) Install the instrument panel cover (Chapter 39-10, 2.A.).

(3) Magnetic compass adjustment / test:
Carry out a test for correct operation of the compass (compass swing):

        - After replacing a major component

        - After replacing the compass

        - After modification to the aircraft.

Compass swing must be performed on the approved compass swing area,
which is at least 100 m (300 ft) from steel structures, electric leading or
other over ground or underground steel equipment or objects.
Compass swing is carried out twice. During the individual test different
aircraft electrical equipment are switched on as mentioned in the form
(Fig. 39-19).

If the compass north is westward from magnetic north, the deviation is
westward, i.e. negative. If the compass north is eastward from magnetic
north, the deviation is eastward, i.e. positive.

###### CAUTION

USE ONLY NON-MAGNETIC TOOLS TO ADJUST THE COMPASS.

DO NOT WEAR OR CARRY METALLIC MATERIAL (WATCHES,
BRACELETS ETC.) WHEN YOU ADJUST THE COMPENSATING
MAGNETS OR OPERATE THE LAND COMPASS. METALLIC
MATERIAL CAN CAUSE ERRORS.

(4) Magnetic compass swing procedure:
(a) Place the aircraft on the approved compass swing area.

(b) Set appropriate electrical equipment to ON (see form Fig. 39-19).

(c) Align the aircraft to magnetic north “N”. Adjust the N-S compensator
so that the compass indicates a heading of 0 degrees.

(d) Align the aircraft to magnetic east “E”. Adjust the E-W compensator
so that the compass indicates a heading of 90 degrees.

(e) Align the aircraft to magnetic south “S”. Reduce the found out
deviation to the half value by the N-S compensator.

(f) Align the aircraft to magnetic west “W”. Reduce the found out
deviation to the half value by E-W compensator.

(g) Turn the aircraft through 360 degrees by grades in magnetic
compass compensation compensation record. Record the deviation
at each 30 degrees. Prepare a deviation table that shows the
corrections that must be applied to each heading. If large deviations
occur when you operate electrical equipment/systems, the deviation
table must also show the corrections to apply at each 30 degrees
heading when the system is operated.

(h) Install the deviation table in the compass card holder below the
compass.
