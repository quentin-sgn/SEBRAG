### 05-10 TIME LIMITS

The inspections described herein constitute what the aircraft manufacturer considers
necessary to ensure the continued airworthiness of WT9 Dynamic LSA aircraft.

###### 1. INTRODUCTION
The inspection program is based on the number of flight hours, operating hours of
engine and calendar time. The method for recording flight hours and operating hours
of engine remains consistent throughout the life of the aircraft.
The owner or operator must record the number of flight hours, operating hours of engine and time of operation used for purpose of complying with inspection intervals.

###### 2. INSPECTION INTERVALS
The aircraft manufacturer’s inspection program has been developed to enable an
owner to accomplish requested inspections and maintenance with Civil Aviation Authorities regulations.
lf two inspection requirements are given for one inspection item, the limit that is
reached first must be applied.
The following inspection intervals at which the items are to be inspected on normal
usage under average environmental conditions.

**A.** **25-hour inspection**
For the new aircraft, the special inspection must be performed at first 25 flight
hours.

**B.** **100-hour inspection**
Complete inspection of aircraft must be performed each 100 flight hours.
At the aircraft with less than 100 flight hours flown per year an annual inspection
must be performed.

**C.** **Annual inspection**
Complete inspection of aircraft must be performed each 12 calendar months.
The inspection items to be covered in the annual inspection are identical to the
100-hour inspection items.

**D.** **Special inspection intervals**
For special inspections specified in other intervals than 100-hour or annual, the
inspection of aircraft’s part or system must be performed each prescribed interval.

**E.** **Unscheduled maintenance checks**
Abnormal aircraft operations require special maintenance checks. Definitions
and unscheduled inspection procedures are listed in the Chapter 05-50.

###### 3. INSPECTION TOLERANCES
The inspection intervals shall not deviate from the inspection time limits shown in table of inspection tolerances (see Tab. 05-1). The exceeding of scheduled inspection
interval shall be used only to finish the flight that started before inspection interval or
for a flight with the purpose to reach a place, where the inspection will be carried out.

###### CAUTION

IF IS THE WORD “max.” IS PRESCRIBED (SEE TABLE 05-4) DO NOT
APPLY TOLERANCE.

_Tab._ _05-1 Inspection Tolerances_

Example: If 100-hour inspection is scheduled, it must be accomplished anytime between 90 and 110 hours. The next 100-hour inspection must be accomplished anytime between 190 and 210 hours, etc.
Each inspection interval can be exceeded by allowed tolerances or can be performed
early at any time prior to the regular interval as provided bellow (see Fig. 05-1):

   - ln the event of compliance of any inspection scheduled, that occurs within inspec
tion tolerances, the next phase due point remains as originally set (see Fig 05-1,
EXAMPLES 1 and 2).

   - ln the event of early compliance of any inspection scheduled, that occurs more

ahead than inspection tolerances of schedule, the next phase due point must be
rescheduled to establish a new due point from the time of early accomplishment
(see Fig 05-1, EXAMPLES 3 and 4).

   - ln the event of late compliance of any inspection scheduled, the next inspection in

sequence retains a due point from the time to the late inspection was originally
scheduled (see Fig 05-1, EXAMPLE 5).

**NOTE**

Inspection intervals and tolerances specified by the original equipment
manufacturers, Airworthiness Directives, etc. take precedence over inspection intervals and tolerances authorized by aircraft manufacturer.

###### 4. SERVICE BULLETINS
The aircraft manufacturer issues service information for owners in the form of three
classes of service bulletins. The service bulletins determine the time limit until the aircraft must comply with.

**A.** **Mandatory Service Bulletin (“Safety Related”)**
Mandatory Service Bulletin is issued in such cases:

     - Failure to meet airworthiness requirements - for repair of structural deficien
cies, the inspection of critical parts, replacement of critical parts of the aircraft's structure and parts used in aircraft assemblies.

     - Necessary airworthiness conditions changes concerning actions having a di
rect impact on the safety, changes in the Pilot´s Operating Handbook (chapters Limitations, Normal Procedures, Emergency Procedures), changes in
the time limits and content maintenance tasks that have an impact on safety.

**B.** **Recommended Service Bulletin**
Recommended Service Bulletin is issued in such cases:

      - Increasing the level of safety concerning aircraft equipment, changes in the

time limits and maintenance tasks content, changes in the Pilot´s Operating
Handbook (chapters General, Performance).

**C.** **Information Service Bulletin**
These bulletins contain information technical-economic nature; the implementation is not required for airworthiness.

The owner should be to ensure that all applicable bulletins are complied with.

###### 5. PUBLICATIONS, REFERENCES
All inspections listed in this chapter, should be accomplished with reference to the
WT9 Dynamic LSA Aircraft Maintenance Manual, Airworthiness Directives, Service
Bulletins, Service Instructions, Service Letters and applicable vendors publications.
